					<description><![CDATA[I am using MAMP PRO and have Document Root setup on Users/me/Sites folder. My localhost works but none of the Drupal 7 Multi-sites within the localhost Drupal sites folders. I receive 403 permissions error. 
I have permissions on the sites folder set to 666 and the settings.php file, so it looks like no issue there. 
I have also tried to set httpd.conf to use the Options Indexes MultiViews settings on all the options stated. Still 403 Forbidden error.
I have no .htaccess in the Sites main folder but have tried to remove or rename the .htaccess file from the localhost folder. Still 403 Forbidden error. 
It&#039;s been 2 months now since I purchased MAMP PRO and have yet to solve this 403 Forbidden error and would appreciate receiving any help that is offered. 
At wits end!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Well nice to see it worked for all of you. I&#039;m still seeing the 403 Forbidden.
&quot;Changing AllowOverride All to AllowOverride None&quot; - DONE, not working.
&quot;Deleting the .htaccess file&quot; - Can&#039;t find one. I&#039;ve looked everywhere. Nothing!

I&#039;m stuck!

PS: The folder where I have my site (wordpress) it&#039;s working great. PhpMyAdmin is working great. But for the folder with an index.html i get 403 Forbidden!!!]]></description>

I had same problem here. Wordpress put htaccess file with modrewrite params in HD root during installation. Very odd, but true. After deleting it everything works fine. It&#039;s only WP installation related problem.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks Joseph!

I had been trying the other fixes mentioned in the MAMP forums and they seemed to cause other issues. Changing &lt;strong&gt;AllowOverride All&lt;/strong&gt; to &lt;strong&gt;AllowOverride None&lt;/strong&gt; would fix the start page, but also destroy my WordPress rewrites.

This did the trick, thanks for sharing it!]]></description>

After reading these suggestions and still not finding the .htaccess file, I followed your fix and it worked. Yea! It did prompt me that I was replacing an existing file on my HD.

So... from another &#039;really really dummy&#039; out there... thank you for sending in this suggestion!]]></description>
