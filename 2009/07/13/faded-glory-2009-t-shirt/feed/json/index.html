I saw someone in the shirt today and thought that's exactly how I feel.  I would love to get one, but does it send the wrong message to our men and women fighting for our country?  I don't know, but some way I think we need to express our concern for this country.  I'm in California and have had a judge steal my vote.  My vote is my voice.",

Not that I am a judge of t-shirts, but I do have my share of the ragged and rugged outerwear garment(s).\n\nOn first view I considered the underlying meaning of the script \"Faded Glory, 2009\".  In the spiritual sense it could be prophecy, in the human sense it could be propaganda, and in the political sense it could be extremely correct.\n\nIn the end it makes me simply want to pray for my country and work toward leadership that works and doesn't make a mockery of the foundations that made us strong.\n\nHeckuva lot to gain from a t-shirt, but I have never been asked to analyze a piece of clothing.  I love the flag, I hate it that Alaska and Hawaii were not included, and I hope the one you have fades nicely and you wear it year after year with pride in the red, white, and blue.\n\nHappy Independence Day everyone.  Mama said \"Go outside and play!\"",
