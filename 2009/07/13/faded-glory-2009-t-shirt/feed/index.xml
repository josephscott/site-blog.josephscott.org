Wow, what a great comment.  I saw someone in the shirt today and thought that&#039;s exactly how I feel.  I would love to get one, but does it send the wrong message to our men and women fighting for our country?  I don&#039;t know, but some way I think we need to express our concern for this country.  I&#039;m in California and have had a judge steal my vote.  My vote is my voice.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hmmm.....the red shirt is certainly nice enough, and the lettering under doesn&#039;t really take away from it&#039;s appeal.  Not that I am a judge of t-shirts, but I do have my share of the ragged and rugged outerwear garment(s).

On first view I considered the underlying meaning of the script &quot;Faded Glory, 2009&quot;.  In the spiritual sense it could be prophecy, in the human sense it could be propaganda, and in the political sense it could be extremely correct.

In the end it makes me simply want to pray for my country and work toward leadership that works and doesn&#039;t make a mockery of the foundations that made us strong.

Heckuva lot to gain from a t-shirt, but I have never been asked to analyze a piece of clothing.  I love the flag, I hate it that Alaska and Hawaii were not included, and I hope the one you have fades nicely and you wear it year after year with pride in the red, white, and blue.

Happy Independence Day everyone.  Mama said &quot;Go outside and play!&quot;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I saw a bunch of people wearing them at Six Flags over Georgia, yesterday.  I don&#039;t know if the political double-meaning was perceived by them (as it was by me...), but the demographic of the typical Six Flags over Georgia patron ensures that A. They got it at Walmart and B. They didn&#039;t realize HI and AK were missing.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[you know i almost bought these shirts cause they were so dang cheap ( i think like 4 dollars or something) but i thought the same thing about the &quot;faded glory&quot; meaning. I totally know it&#039;s a brand name...but uhm yeah, it&#039;s directly underneath a picture of (part of) the US and the flag and says &quot;faded glory&quot; just couldn&#039;t bring myself to buy them...bought some different ones instead. And even though i lived in hawaii i completely missed the fact that it wasn&#039;t included... and you know what i bet they did sell them at wal mart there, i bet people still bought them, we&#039;re very used to a picture of the USA not including those. strange.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[How funny.  It seems I&#039;ve seen lots of shirts like this around, too, but didn&#039;t notice the missing states.  Good eye.

I&#039;ve always thought it&#039;d be cool to make red &#038; blue tie-dye shirts for the 4th but wondered if that might carry an unintended political message as well. (I just happen to dig tie-dye for the artistic element...)]]></description>
