I think if anyone where to find out other wise there would be a huge outcry over it, and rightly so.\n\nI think the problem with opening a new tab with Flash is that the Flash app gets all the key board events when it has focus, you need to click on part of the browser to give FF focus again, then Ctrl + T will open a new tab again, even with flash content on the page.",

So, well done Firefox.",
