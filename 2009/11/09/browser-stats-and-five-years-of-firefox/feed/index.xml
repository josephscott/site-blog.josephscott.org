I&#039;ve sniffed network traffic while using Google Chrome and have found no evidence that Google is recording what it is doing.  I think if anyone where to find out other wise there would be a huge outcry over it, and rightly so.

I think the problem with opening a new tab with Flash is that the Flash app gets all the key board events when it has focus, you need to click on part of the browser to give FF focus again, then Ctrl + T will open a new tab again, even with flash content on the page.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Chrome is a nice browser. I must say I do like it despite the fact that Google is probably recording the web history. Seems quite quick. The developer options are useful but cannot be compared to Firebug.

There is one thing in Firefox that is a bit annoying (possibly a bug). When on a website with flash content the Ctrl + T option does not work.

Btw, nice blog.]]></description>

I&#039;ve been using a combination of Firefox and Safari for awhile.  Now I&#039;m swapping Safari for Chrome to see how that does.  I still use Firebug so much I don&#039;t see giving up Firefox as something that would happen anytime soon.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Firefox is my favourite browser for a number of reasons. The main two are: the open source community and the number of plugins. The plugins are great. They help so much in doing different things. I noticed that Google recently launched a big advertising campaign for their Chrome browser but I have my reservations with Google as they seem to have similar goal to Microsoft. So, well done Firefox.]]></description>
