					<description><![CDATA[I do not understand Bloglines.  I have been begging them for a verification email for months - at least 3 requests. What do I get? Bupkus. I have therefore sent two requests to Customer Service asking for a verification email. What have I gotten so far? Bupkus.  I am going to suggest that they send it to me by carrier pigeon. That is, if I ever hear from them. (And yes, i did enter the correct email address.)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thank you for writing this.

I felt the EXACT same way when I abandoned Bloglines in favor of Google Reader. I didn&#039;t particularly care for the usability of Google Reader, but I just couldn&#039;t deal with the frustrations of Bloglines anymore.]]></description>
