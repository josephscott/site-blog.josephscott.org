By law the trust funds can only invest only in Treasury debt.  This creates a situation, like the one that existed in the final years of the Clinton administration, when despite surpluses we still add to our gross national debt.  Even in the one year that we ran a surplus outside of the various trusts, we added to our debt.  I agree that we to live within our means and find a way to match government income with expenditures, but very few people think that we should expend considerable energy to pay off our debt.  The government is not a household.  As Alan Greenspan stated around the Clinton-Bush transition, having zero national debt would pose significant problems.  Aside from government trust funds, many aspects of our financial system rely on Treasury debt.  Without any debt the Fed could not control the money supply and therefore would be almost completely unable to control inflation.  Treasury debt is also the basis for FDIC insured savings accounts.  We need some Treasury debt, but not too much.  Clearly we are on an unsustainable path and need to rein in spending and/or increase taxes.  Unfortunately, we will probably have to do both.  But for these reasons the government will almost certainly continue to issue new debt forever.  All we can hope for is that it will shrink in comparison to the size of our economy and therefore not be burdensome to future generations.",
            "content_text": "In reply to Joseph Scott.\n\nBecause of Federal laws governing government trust funds, such as the various Social Security trust funds amongst many others, the gross federal debt will almost always increase even when running surpluses.  By law the trust funds can only invest only in Treasury debt.  This creates a situation, like the one that existed in the final years of the Clinton administration, when despite surpluses we still add to our gross national debt.  Even in the one year that we ran a surplus outside of the various trusts, we added to our debt.  I agree that we to live within our means and find a way to match government income with expenditures, but very few people think that we should expend considerable energy to pay off our debt.
