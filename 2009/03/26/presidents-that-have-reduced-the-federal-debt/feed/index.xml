From what I gather some economists believe that have some small amount of debt would be ok/good in order to help leverage more financial activity.  At this point we are so far away from having zero debt or a surplus that any discussion about it being good or bad is wasted time.]]></description>

Since the claim in this post is &quot;Since 1940 the federal debt has only dropped year over year five times&quot; John Quincy Adams and Andrew Jackson don&#039;t apply.  Both of them were well before 1940.

You may be interested in seeing the complete list of all years when the federal debt when down instead of up (and who was President at the time) that I put together at http://josephscott.org/archives/2009/04/history-of-the-federal-debt/]]></description>

I&#039;m not talking about FDIC insurance, I&#039;m talking about the interest you make in savings accounts.  For an account at a bank to be FDIC insured a large portion of the your money MUST be invested in Treasury debt because it is deemed to be the safest investment there is.  This prevents banks from making risky investments with money that the FDIC insures with the method you explain above.  Every savings account is largely based off of Treasury debt. Insurance is a separate issue.]]></description>

The FDIC claims that they are &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fdic.gov/consumers/banking/facts/index.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;funded by premiums paid by insured banks&lt;/a&gt;:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;What is the source of funding used by the FDIC to pay insured depositors of a failed bank?&lt;/strong&gt;
The FDICâ€™s deposit insurance fund consists of premiums already paid by insured banks and interest earnings on its investment portfolio of U.S. Treasury securities. No federal or state tax revenues are involved.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I believe this point was also brought up on a recent episode of 60 Minutes.  According to Andrew Gray at the FDIC there is a line of credit available from the Treasury department to the FDIC, which has only been used once (this was back in September 2008, isn&#039;t clear if this has happened since) in the 1990s.  From a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fdic.gov/news/news/press/2008/pr08084.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;press release dated 25 September 2008&lt;/a&gt;:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The fund is 100 percent industry-backed.
...
As per our authorizing statute, any money we might borrow from the Treasury must be paid back from industry assessments. Only once in the FDIC&#039;s history have we had to borrow from the Treasury â€“ in the early 1990s â€“ and that money was paid back with interest in less than two years.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I think you are reading too much into my post.  I didn&#039;t claim that all federal debt should be eliminated.  My only statement beyond the facts was to wonder if the trend of only increasing and never decreasing (over the last 50 plus years) will ever change.  Safe to read into that that I tend to think it wouldn&#039;t be a completely bad thing for that trend to change, at least just a little bit :-)]]></description>

Because of Federal laws governing government trust funds, such as the various Social Security trust funds amongst many others, the gross federal debt will almost always increase even when running surpluses.  By law the trust funds can only invest only in Treasury debt.  This creates a situation, like the one that existed in the final years of the Clinton administration, when despite surpluses we still add to our gross national debt.  Even in the one year that we ran a surplus outside of the various trusts, we added to our debt.  I agree that we to live within our means and find a way to match government income with expenditures, but very few people think that we should expend considerable energy to pay off our debt.  The government is not a household.  As Alan Greenspan stated around the Clinton-Bush transition, having zero national debt would pose significant problems.  Aside from government trust funds, many aspects of our financial system rely on Treasury debt.  Without any debt the Fed could not control the money supply and therefore would be almost completely unable to control inflation.  Treasury debt is also the basis for FDIC insured savings accounts.  We need some Treasury debt, but not too much.  Clearly we are on an unsustainable path and need to rein in spending and/or increase taxes.  Unfortunately, we will probably have to do both.  But for these reasons the government will almost certainly continue to issue new debt forever.  All we can hope for is that it will shrink in comparison to the size of our economy and therefore not be burdensome to future generations.]]></description>
