The other way is to have all of the hardware be IPv6 compatible.\n\nI am unaware of any services or sites yet that are IPv6 only but almost all network infrastructure hardware have supported both IPv4 and IPv6 for a number of years now. I wouldn't be surprised if your DSL modem and beyond already supports IPv6.\n\nI bet the problem is your router. To test, you could try connecting the MAC directly to your DSL modem with the setting in OSX back to 'Automatic'. If the site loads right up, then you know the problem is your router.
