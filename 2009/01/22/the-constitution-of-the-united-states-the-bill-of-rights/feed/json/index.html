Taking a step back it's an interesting concept, allowing someone to still have a high degree of freedom while trying to convict them.",

Since you're innocent until proven otherwise, you shouldn't be forced to be incarcerated until trial, right? What if you're acquitted? The state has unreasonably taken your liberty.\n\nBut we need some way to compel you to show up at your trial, rather than having you just run off. Bail is a surrender of personal assets (temporarily) until you can be tried. It's a guarantee (in tangible assets) that you'll show up - and in fact it's lost entirely if you skip bail (in addition to you being hunted down and tried anyway).\n\nThe prohibition on excessive bail was to ensure that judges wouldn't set a bail amount that was so high defendants couldn't make bail, just to force them to sit in jail. While bail amounts are determined based on the severity of the crime and your likelihood to flee, most of them are set by statute, to ensure fair application.\n\nIt's really a remarkable system. We do what we can to free even those who will later be found guilty in order to ensure that those who are innocent are not unfairly held.",
