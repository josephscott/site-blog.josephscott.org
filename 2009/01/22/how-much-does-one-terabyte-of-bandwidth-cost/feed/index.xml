					<description><![CDATA[Nice article, just to add some updated data, the incoming data transfer for Amazon EC2 is now 0 (zero). You can see an evolution of costs here:

					<description><![CDATA[I think the last paragraph is very important:

&quot;It isnâ€™t clear that all of the servers listed above would do well at serving 1 TB per month, thatâ€™s lot of sustained traffic. If we needed two servers to adequately deal with the load then that changes the cost structure quite a bit.&quot;

This is one of the reasons S3 seems more expensive - I don&#039;t know if S3&#039;s SLA states it explicitly, but I would expect that a file hosted on S3 would continue to be served reliably even with a sudden spike in traffic, whereas if the file were on a single server, a spike might overwhelm that server.  One of the tradeoffs for paying a bit more for &quot;cloud&quot; services is the ability to handle spikes like that, without having to overprovision.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Interestingly enough, 18 months and the prices are still about the same.  Amazon S3 is only $20 less per TB than it was when you wrote this.

Dedicated offerings keep the same prices and bandwidth allotment.  The only thing that changed were better CPU/motherboards.

I&#039;d say this post has enough legs to be relatively on the spot for another 18 months!  :)]]></description>

This post is now more than 18 months old, I&#039;d expect bandwidth costs to continue to drop.

As for launching a WP network, &quot;it depends&quot; is best answer I could give to such a broad question.  There are so many other details that weigh in on that sort of decision.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[You could serve the 1TB, 100 times using a 100TB.com dedicated server. ($199)  For $98, you could use their cloud service and get 10TB of transfer.

They are on SoftLayer, which seems pretty good.

My setup is at ThePlanet and it is been peachy since 2003.  You get a better deal than the advertised price if you pick up the phone and call.

I&#039;d love to know, if you were launching a WordPress MU/3.0 network today, would you go with dedicated server(s), AWS or something else?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Informative. How does this math for storage map to streaming of video?
&quot;With Nielsen reporting 138 million unique viewers in the U.S. alone.  The growth in total streams is even greater, increasing 26 percent year-over-year to a total of 11.2 billion streams.  In addition, Coda Research Consultancy forecasts that U.S. mobile handset data traffic will reach 327 petabytes a month in 2010. Mobile video will account for the lion share of that traffic&quot;.

I tried doing a map for 327 petabytes/month? It scores in millions. should it be computed differently?
