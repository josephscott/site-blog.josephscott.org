					<description><![CDATA[I have never really been a fan of Vista, so my experience in it is rather limited. However, with an astronomical investment that I plan to make and upgrade my excuse for a computer, I may be able to experience 7 in due time.

Well, in the defense of Microsoft, they did say that they were building Windows 7 based on Vista. So the UI is not surprising...]]></description>

I&#039;m not thrilled with the Vista style UIs, something about is just too big and awkward.  My main Windows setup for testing is still XP, so my time in Windows 7 land will more limited :-)]]></description>
