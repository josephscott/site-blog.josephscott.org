					<description><![CDATA[Great advice Joseph.

I&#039;ve started receiving a lot of these calls recently too. I am always on time on one mortgage and actually way ahead on the other. And I checked with my bank and they confirmed everything is fine. So I know these calls are BS!

I receive a combination of robo-call messages and a real person messages. After the 3rd or 4th &#039;real person&#039; call from the same guy in the space of a couple of weeks, I called him back on the number he left (a local area code number) to do some investigation work. He answered but said he couldn&#039;t hear me, so he called me back. He said he was with Realty Network (probably a lie). When I told him my house isn&#039;t being foreclosed on and politely asked him to stop calling or I&#039;d seek legal action he got very abusive, so I responded in kind. From the call quality, his accent, and the line delay it sounded like he was from an Indian call center.

Like many of this type of caller/company, these guys do not adhere to the National Do Not Call list. They call from &#039;restricted&#039; numbers, provide no option to unsubscribe, and often laugh when you mention the list. And even when they do provide this option it&#039;s often just a way of determining if a phone number is &#039;live&#039; so they can bug you even more. So using Unsubscribe options can sometimes be worse than not responding.

Either way folks, like Joseph says, don&#039;t be tricked by these clowns. They are trying to trick you!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I get 3-5 or more of these a week. We bought our house 3 months ago, so we haven&#039;t had time for foreclosure. :D

For most, if you select 2 it will take you off their list forever. They are required to offer a way to get off their list, but you have to listen for a while to figure that out. They will keep calling, which is frustrating.

Thanks for reminding everyone that these are scams.]]></description>
