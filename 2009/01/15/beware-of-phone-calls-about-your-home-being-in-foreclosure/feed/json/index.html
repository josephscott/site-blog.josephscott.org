            "content_html": "Great advice Joseph.\n\nI've started receiving a lot of these calls recently too. I am always on time on one mortgage and actually way ahead on the other. And I checked with my bank and they confirmed everything is fine. So I know these calls are BS!\n\nI receive a combination of robo-call messages and a real person messages. After the 3rd or 4th 'real person' call from the same guy in the space of a couple of weeks, I called him back on the number he left (a local area code number) to do some investigation work. He answered but said he couldn't hear me, so he called me back. He said he was with Realty Network (probably a lie). When I told him my house isn't being foreclosed on and politely asked him to stop calling or I'd seek legal action he got very abusive, so I responded in kind. From the call quality, his accent, and the line delay it sounded like he was from an Indian call center.\n\nLike many of this type of caller/company, these guys do not adhere to the National Do Not Call list. They call from 'restricted' numbers, provide no option to unsubscribe, and often laugh when you mention the list. And even when they do provide this option it's often just a way of determining if a phone number is 'live' so they can bug you even more. So using Unsubscribe options can sometimes be worse than not responding.\n\nEither way folks, like Joseph says, don't be tricked by these clowns. They are trying to trick you!",
