					<description><![CDATA[Whilst it is true that for simple blogging, having an export file and your theme will cater for the majority of your backups, it will not extend to more complex uses of Wordpress.

However once you start using more complex plugins (e.g. capsman), they need their own export/import/revert features (which it does, happily).

It would be nice if there were hooks into the import/export page for plugins to use.

(or have I just missed them?)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[http://joseph.randomnetworks.com/archives/2006/02/06/akismet-review/
Here you reviewd about askimet.

Do we have some option of askimet for wordpress 1.2.
if not what do you suggest to avoid spams on comment (except suggestion of upgrade of wp).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s funny I knew about the export feature in wordpress.com blogs but when I moved to self hosted wordpress I forgot about it. Instead i&#039;ve been manually backing up my databases. Thanks for reminding me of a simpler way to do it :)

One of my biggest pet peeves is a required log-in. We all fight spam on a daily basis, but I am not ever going to make anybody go to the hassle of creating an account with some impossible to remember wordpress generated password and having to click activation links just to write a comment!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[If you stop paying Typepad they stop serving your media.

If you stop paying WordPress.com, your media is still available. It&#039;s also hotlink-able.

Finally the core WXR importer actually handles media. It&#039;ll fetch remote images and add them to your local media store.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve complained about the registration thing on Craig&#039;s blog as well.  Craig, if you need a &quot;log in&quot; type feature, can I suggest Disqus or Intense Debate?  I&#039;m getting tired of leaving comments on others&#039; blogs for you. :-)

Also, Craig, regarding media, there are a couple Amazon S3 plugins that will store your images on Amazon S3 instead of directly on the blog itself.  As for backup, I host myself on EC2, providing scalability if I need it (so far haven&#039;t ever needed it, even being TechCrunch&#039;d, TechMeme&#039;d, GuyKawasaki&#039;d, and more), and I send all my backups regularly to S3 in the cloud via s3sync.

There are other services that provide Wordpress.org (downloadable) installs, and provide backup service on top of it all.  Or you can always just syndicate your blog to another platform and do it that way.  There are a ton of solutions out there.  I&#039;m confused as to what type of solution you&#039;re looking for.]]></description>
