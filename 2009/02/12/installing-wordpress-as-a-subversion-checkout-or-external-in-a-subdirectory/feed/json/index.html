These plugins most all include the following line:\n\nrequire_once('../../../wp-config.php');\n\nWhich means you cannot do what I was suggesting with using the Alias directive in Apache without creating an additional wp-config.php. Essentially, where ever your wp-content folder is located, a wp-config.php file must also be located for those plugins that try to include it.\n\nTo get my example to work, you would need to create a wp-config.php file in the same directory where you put the wp-content folder. In this wp-config.php, you would add a require_once function call with the absolute path where your actual wp-config.php is located. If you installed via subversion to /home/example.com/public_html/, then...\n\n\n\nI'm in the process of moving a site to a new server and will be testing this out. Either way, I'm quite pleased the defines WP_CONTENT_DIR and WP_CONTENT_URL are available to us.",
