I have a life insurance policy with them and regret having ever chosen MetLife due to the poor customer service I have experienced.  Seems like their office is the only one in the state.  Perhaps that is why the manager of that office has been so rude.  To me, it is like a snake pit.  Now I'm looking elsewhere for my insurance needs.",

Also like Utahcon my insurance company acted like a mediator for me. The lady who it me had esurance but they used that same line on me about Utah law. Bottom line I got my rental fees reimbursed $75 day, and they cut me a check for $20,965 which is the good condition kbb value.\n\nI guess what I'm trying to say is it's going to take an insurance lawyer to get it figured out for you.",

Yikes, talk about coming back for more.\n\nWhat's really bad about this experience is that the same car got hit when we lived in California (again, 100% the other persons fault) and had zero problems from Progressive on getting everything taken care of.  They paid for every last dime of the rental and didn't give us any grief.  I was so happy that I called them up for a quote to switch my insurance to them.  I ended up not switching because they wanted $300 a year more than what I was already paying for the same coverage.",
