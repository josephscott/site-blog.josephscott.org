Going to school, getting an education, that&#039;s part of the self-reliance responsibility.  Caring for the poor and needy isn&#039;t always about money, providing service time helps as well.  How each person and family does that is a decision best left to them.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[i agree with you, i think that is a great statement. Simple and clear, and all the people should have, without orders or religions, this kind of statements by themselves. As human persons we should take care for every one of us. great blog, Joseph, i&#039;ll keep visiting!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I like that statement a lot. Especially with all of the heated debates dealing with welfare, the government, taxes, etc, I think the real important things get lost: our personal responsibility and focusing on that.

I think I&#039;m going to start worrying about how I personally am helping others rather than how everyone else is handling the situation. :)]]></description>
