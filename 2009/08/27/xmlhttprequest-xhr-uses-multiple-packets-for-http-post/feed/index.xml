					<description><![CDATA[October 2016 and I am experiencing this problem with Safari 9.1.3 (10601.7.8) on Mac OS and also on iOS 10.0.2.
It is sending the HTTP headers in one packet and the body in a second packet, even for a very small request.

I am implementing a tiny IPv6 HTTP server on Arduino, which can&#039;t currently cope with requests spanning multiple packets. So very frustrating that it works with Chrome but not Safari.

The good news however it that Chrome 53.0.2785.143 (also on Mac) is sending a single packet, containing both the headers and body.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In case you&#039;re curious about why this happens in IE-- the headers are sent by WinINET, but the calling pattern of XHR through URLMon to WinINET results in going async, which means that the POST body bytes aren&#039;t typically supplied to WinINET until after the headers have been sent. This is something that we looked at changing in IE10 but ran out of time. In practice, the performance impact is pretty small.

To chandru&#039;s question: The issue here is that the POST body can get lost if the browsing process is torn down in the window between the headers being sent to WinINET and the body being sent down. As a consequence, while a window is closing, you could end up with the headers and no body. (Fiddler will warn if it sees this happen).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thank you very much! We have such a web app that is doing lots of updates and to us this is enormously important. After doing some wiresharking and emulating some loss, jitter, low bandwidth and reordering (using tc) and reading your post I decided to change all the ajax post requests to ajax get requests hoping it had something to do with the 2 packet issue. And it did: after that no more strange 404&#039;s on the ajax calls appeared in the apache access log. I still didn&#039;t figure out why exactly, but emulating these conditions is no easy task either, so I may never find out.]]></description>
