This is something that we looked at changing in IE10 but ran out of time. In practice, the performance impact is pretty small.\n\nTo chandru's question: The issue here is that the POST body can get lost if the browsing process is torn down in the window between the headers being sent to WinINET and the body being sent down. As a consequence, while a window is closing, you could end up with the headers and no body. (Fiddler will warn if it sees this happen).",
