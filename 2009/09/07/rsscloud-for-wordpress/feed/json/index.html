I double checked and ping-o-matic was working, but did not make a difference, then as I was about to give up I came across your blog.\n\nSo I wanted to thank you very, very much!! RSSCloud seems to be working fantastic for me. I'll be sure to let you know if I have any additional feedback.\n\nBest regards,\nJosh",

The problem is that the check is made after calling back to the client's notify url and you always return a \"Registration successful\" regardless. As a result there is no way for the client to tell that the registration has failed.\n\nThis is a fairly common problem for people that use feedburner. In many cases the client will be subscribed to the feedburner url rather than the original WordPress feed url, which means the cloud registration is guaranteed to fail silently (assuming I've understood the code correctly).\n\nOne possible fix would be to improve the error checking so the client is at least informed of the failure. A nicer solution would be to accept any url that was requested in the registration since, at least in your case, the registration url is always unique for a particular blog is it not? The feed url that the client is using shouldn't matter.\n\nOf course the next problem with feedburner feeds is that there is a delay between when the blog is updated and the feedburner feed actually reflects those changes. If a client receives a notification that the feed has updated and immediately refreshes that feed, the data it gets back will be out of date, so it won't see the update.\n\nIt's possible this can be solved by WordPress automatically pinging feedburner (if it doesn't already) and a short delay in the client to allow time for the feedburner version of the feed to refresh. However we won't know how workable that solution is until problem number one has been addressed.",
