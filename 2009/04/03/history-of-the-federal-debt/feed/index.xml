Correct, during Clinton&#039;s years in office the Federal debt continued to increase. The &quot;balanced&quot; budget was voodoo economics as they &quot;stole&quot; from SS in an attempt to show a balanced budget.]]></description>

I linked to the data sources, you are welcome to double check them.  I didn&#039;t see any dips in the total federal debt during the Clinton years.

As I understand, there were some years with a budget surplus.  But that surplus was either not big enough, or wasn&#039;t used towards actually reducing the outstanding debt.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Joseph,
After looking at several federal debt charts it appears that the debt took a few dips when Clinton was in office.  Shouldn&#039;t those years also appear on this chart?]]></description>

I ended up doing the leg work for this because I hadn&#039;t seen it reported on previously.  What&#039;s going in the current year is important, but it would be nice to see folks talking about the long term trends as well.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I wish the National Debt was reported on more than the yearly budget deficit is.  So many people don&#039;t realize there is a difference, but the difference is enormous.  It&#039;s a shame we can&#039;t get someone in there to make it go down instead of up for a change.  Great post, BTW!]]></description>
