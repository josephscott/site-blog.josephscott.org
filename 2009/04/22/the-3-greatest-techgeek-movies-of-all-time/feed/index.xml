					<description><![CDATA[Your old office mates just held the first &quot;IT Movie Night&quot; last Friday. Our feature presentation was Sneakers! (Especially appropriate given the CSU-wide security audit we&#039;re going through.)

I totally agree with your comments re Hackers. If you want to see a *really* bad &quot;tech/geek&quot; movie, try The Net. (gag!)]]></description>

I loved Wargames, I must say that I have watched it many times and I still don&#039;t get bored. I must mention that Star Wars is probably one of my fav&#039;s and I still watch them today.]]></description>

I might have the 20th anniversary DVD, I&#039;ll have to check.  And if I&#039;m going to get it out I may as well watch it again :-)]]></description>

The matrix really was pretty exciting, but very unrealistic and I didn&#039;t think the trippiness factor was as great as everyone says, but it was very computer geeky nonetheless.]]></description>

I don&#039;t know what your DVD has but mine is a 2 disc 20th Anniversary Collector&#039;s Edition that was released in 2002.  It&#039;s got LOTS of goodies!  Commentaries, deleted scenes, &quot;making of&quot; type stuff, storyboards, etc.  Not to mention you could watch it in Spanish or FRENCH!  That&#039;s when you know you&#039;ve got a really snazzy edition!]]></description>

Having only watched some of &quot;The Matrix&quot; on TV I don&#039;t have a full comparison, but it strikes me as being at least as much fantasy as Tron was.]]></description>

I actually watched most of Hackers recently.  It had glimmers of being a good geek movie, but those moments were over shadowed by the entire rest of the film :-)]]></description>
