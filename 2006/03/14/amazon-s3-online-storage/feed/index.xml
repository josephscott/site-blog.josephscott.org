					<description><![CDATA[I just signed up for an Amazon.com S3 after reading a great review of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jungledisk.com&quot;/ rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;JunleDisk&lt;/a&gt; on a Mac blog.  My first thought was this would be a good candidate for development for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://code.google.com/p/macfuse/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;MacFUSE project&lt;/a&gt; ran by Google.

					<description><![CDATA[Hi, you can also take a look at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ibackup.com/ibwin_new.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;IBackup for Windows&lt;/a&gt;, which was recently rated by PC World as the `best all-around backup service. For users who wish to backup on character sets other than US/English, IBackup now offers the flexibility to opt for the new &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ibackup.com/ibwin_international.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;IBackup for Windows - International Edition&lt;/a&gt;.

 With IBackup for Windows the backup and restores of files and folders are fast, easy and reliable IBackup has easy-to-use wizards for interactive backups, restores and backup/restore scheduling. IBackup for Windows also has the look and feel of the Windows Explorer with some great features to backup and restore important data. IBackup accounts are compatible with most FTP clients on most platforms providing a powerful flexible tool to transfer files.

A good thing about IBackup is that the online account can be mapped as a local drive onto your computer with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ibackup.com/IBDrive_new.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;IDrive&lt;/a&gt;. Then you can work on the files and folders stored in your account, edit and save them. You can also drag and drop files to the IBackup account from the Windows explorer. IDrive for Mac is an excellent desktop interface for working with your IBackup account and Mac. It allows operations like copy-and-paste, drag and drop, direct editing and more.

&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ibackup.com/IDrive_mmedia.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;IDrive Multimedia &lt;/a&gt; is an advanced drive mapping technology, which can stream multimedia content using a media player. IDrive Multimedia is the most flexible Internet drive ever designed to support all multimedia formats that your PC applications support. If you need to work with database-like files such as Access, Act! or Filemaker, then use IDrive Multimedia. IDrive and IDrive Multimedia, the network mapping applications, do have SSL encryption enabled by default.

You can also try the browser-based application ‘Web-Manager’ that lets you to share files or folders with others by creating sharable links and emailing them to others. You can add sharing properties like password protection, so that people who are supposed to view them can view your files. You can Write Enable your shared files and folders so that others can modify your files and upload them back to your online account. You can also enable ‘locking’ for your shared files to avoid any mistaken overwriting. It also allows `private sharing of data’ instantly with another IBackup user.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Heck with Amazon! Try http://www.myotherdrive.com./  This site gives each user a free 5GB online drive which can be used for not only online (offsite) backup, but also to provide media sharing.

The allows the user to create folders (just like the Windows (r) Explorer), and these folders can be shared to the groups you set up (family, friends, coworkers, etc.).  You can give users &#039;view,&#039; &#039;add,&#039; &#039;modify,&#039; &#039;delete,&#039; and &#039;download&#039; access.

Unlike a lot of other online storages sites, files can be uploaded / downloaded in bulk - none of that one-at-a-time, file-by-file torture.  And also unlike other sites, each individual file can be any size (up to 2GB).  Most sites place a limit on individual files.

The site is more than storage and sharing - you can use the built-in view to view image files (JPEG, GIF, PNG, and BMP) as well as text files (.txt, .xml, .properties, etc.).  You can even rotate image files on the fly.

Looking ahead, the site plans to offer content tagging (associate keywords to files) and content search.  This will permit you to find interesting and  &#039;cool&#039; content.  This feature, coupled with an upcoming media player, and the site will offer capabilities beyond &#039;fad&#039; sites like YouTube.

Oh yeah, it&#039;s free - check it out: http://www.myotherdrive.com.]]>/</description>

					<description><![CDATA[Joseph,

This is exciting news indeed!

I was a bit puzzled by the long URL as well. Turns out, there is in fact a shorter URL:
http://aws.amazon.com/s3
I came across it while reading the release notes for the service:
http://developer.amazonwebservices.com/connect/entry.jspa?externalID=122&#038;categoryID=49]]></description>
