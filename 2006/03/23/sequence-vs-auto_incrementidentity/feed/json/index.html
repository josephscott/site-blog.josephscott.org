            "content_html": "If you want to ensure that you have unique values in a column then you should be placing some sort of unique constraint on it.  As you note in the link you provided fields that make use of sequences or identities are usually primary keys, which would include a unique constraint.  Having an identity field enforce uniqueness is one more thing to remember.  What if you don't want your identity field to enforce uniqueness?  I have no idea why you'd want that, but it is one more thing to remember.  Either way I'd contend that the correct way to enforce this is with a unique constraint.\n\nIn the link you provided you mention that the standard specifies the identity method and not the sequence method.  I'm assuming that you are talking about SQL-2003 since you mention at the top of that page.  There is a PDF covering new features in SQL-2003 at <a href=\"http://www.wiscorp.com/SQLStandards.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.wiscorp.com/SQLStandards.html</a> see the link <a href=\"http://www.wiscorp.com/SQL2003Features.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">SQL 2003 Paper</a> (PDF) under Key Readings.  According to this PDF both identity (pages 21-22) and sequences (pages  15-20) are included in the standard.  I don't know if Oracle and PostgreSQL sequences meet the spec exactly, but to indicate them as non-standard because the don't support identity is clearly wrong.  This is also supported by the <a href=\"http://www.acm.org/sigmod/record/issues/0403/E.JimAndrew-standard.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">SQL:2003 Has Been Published</a> PDF from ACM which mentions both sequences and identities as part of the SQL 2003 standard.\n\nOverall I like your comparison.  The PostgreSQL version you mention is over a year old so there may be some changes that could go into your list.",
