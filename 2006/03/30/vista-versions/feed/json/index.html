The article at http://www.microsoft-watch.com/article2/0,2180,1948571,00.asp states that Windows Server 2003 will be replaced by the codename Longhorn Server, scheduled for release in 2007.\n\nBeyond 2007, the article reveals 'Microsoft was shooting to roll out a new version of Windows desktop and Windows server every two years.'  This is despite the fact, as an analyst notes in the article, that Windows development has historically been serialized, not in parallel.\n\nBefore the latest announced delay in shipping Vista (to January 2007), Vista was scheduled to be followed by codename Fiji (aka Vista R2) in 2008, with Fiji to be followed by Vienna (fka Blackcomb) in 2010.  In the server department, Longhorn Server R2 is scheduled for 2009, to be followed by Vienna Server in 2011.",
