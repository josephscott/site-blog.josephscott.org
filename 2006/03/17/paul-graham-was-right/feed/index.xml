					<description><![CDATA[Paul Graham has always written the way he has written. That (among real reasoning) includes making assertions and peddling his own views as a kind of fact. The same people that are applauding Graham for &quot;brilliant reasoning&quot; when he makes assertions that fit their world-view, criticize him for the absurdity of even making assertions, when they don&#039;t fit their world-view. Not that they shouldn&#039;t, but the inconsistency is just funny in an ironic kind of way. :)]]></description>
