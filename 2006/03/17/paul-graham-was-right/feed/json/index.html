The same people that are applauding Graham for \"brilliant reasoning\" when he makes assertions that fit their world-view, criticize him for the absurdity of even making assertions, when they don't fit their world-view. Not that they shouldn't, but the inconsistency is just funny in an ironic kind of way. :)",
