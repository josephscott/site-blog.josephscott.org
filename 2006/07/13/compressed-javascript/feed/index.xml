					<description><![CDATA[I have a question. Isn&#039;t it much easier to just use one of the many online Javascript compressors available today for this (like http://www.giftofspeed.com/javascript-compressor/ or http://javascriptcompressor.com/ ) and just compress the individual javascript files instead of going through all the hassle to set it all up yourself? Thanks]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey,

Do you guys think there is a performance hit by using mod_gzip instead of this technique? Would pre-compression give any long-lasting performance improvements?

Or do you guys think that with the caching in mod_gzip it becomes irrelevant for static files like JS anyway because the server will only zip the first time and not onwards?

Your comments pls]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[For those of you who can&#039;t get this to work here is some more detailed information.

.htaccess
RewriteEngine On
AddEncoding x-gzip .gz
RewriteCond %{HTTP:Accept-encoding} gzip
RewriteCond %{HTTP_USER_AGENT} !Safari
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME}.gz -f
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ $1.gz [QSA,L]

This one will work on css and js files any file really, just gzip it and if it exists it will use it (unless the client is using safari).

To make this work you have to fix the mime records that apache uses. In httpd.conf comment the global setting that looks like this:

#AddType application/x-tar .tgz

Then you need to make sure that your &quot;AddEncoding x-gzip .gz&quot; directive will work by setting your directory to have &quot;AllowOverride All&quot;. Still in httpd.conf in my vhost I added:

        &#060;Directory /home/username/public_html&#062;
               AllowOverride All
        &#060;/Directory&#062;

If there are still problems edit mime.type and comment out the gzip line. Don&#039;t forget to restart apache. I hope this saves someone hours.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The only problem I see with the suggested methods is that most rely on having the possibility to use .htaccess, a thing I cannot do on one hosting service I use... The solution more interesting for me was the first one proposed byKenrick, because it use a .php script but unfortunately the link to the script doesn&#039;t work anymore... :(]]></description>
