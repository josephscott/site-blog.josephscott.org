            "content_html": "I thought <i>Superman Returns</i> was terrific. It carried on very logically from what was established in <i>Superman I</i> &amp; <i>II</i>. I was surpised they managed to pull that off, as I was quite skeptical about that aspect.\n\nI do agree with you, though, that Brandon Routh's performance was the surprise highlight of the film! I thought I'd have trouble accepting someone besides  Christopher Reeve as Superman on the big screen, but Routh made the transition as seamless as possible. I really feel like this movie was a fitting tribute to Reeve, while also setting up the new adventures to come.\n\nRegarding the Clark Kent disguise that another responder mentioned, I just see that as part of the fun of Superman. That piece of the myth was invented in a simpler time and I'm glad it has managed to stick around through all of the incarnations.\n\nYeah, it might be a hokey disguise but if you can believe a man can fly, then buying into this is part of the package. I think Reeve and Routh did the best job differentiating the Kent and Superman personas to make it as believable as possible.\n\nAlthough I think Dean Cain did a fantastic job as Clark Kent, I always felt the two personas were basically the same on <i>Lois &amp; Clark</i> - making the Superman disguise (as it was in the case of that show, rather than CK) less believable.\n\nI would say generally the same about the George Reeves Superman vs. Kent, but that show was from a simpler time as well.",
