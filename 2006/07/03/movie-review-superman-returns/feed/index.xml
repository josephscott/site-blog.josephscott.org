					<description><![CDATA[I thought &lt;i&gt;Superman Returns&lt;/i&gt; was terrific. It carried on very logically from what was established in &lt;i&gt;Superman I&lt;/i&gt; &#038; &lt;i&gt;II&lt;/i&gt;. I was surpised they managed to pull that off, as I was quite skeptical about that aspect.

I do agree with you, though, that Brandon Routh&#039;s performance was the surprise highlight of the film! I thought I&#039;d have trouble accepting someone besides  Christopher Reeve as Superman on the big screen, but Routh made the transition as seamless as possible. I really feel like this movie was a fitting tribute to Reeve, while also setting up the new adventures to come.

Regarding the Clark Kent disguise that another responder mentioned, I just see that as part of the fun of Superman. That piece of the myth was invented in a simpler time and I&#039;m glad it has managed to stick around through all of the incarnations.

Yeah, it might be a hokey disguise but if you can believe a man can fly, then buying into this is part of the package. I think Reeve and Routh did the best job differentiating the Kent and Superman personas to make it as believable as possible.

Although I think Dean Cain did a fantastic job as Clark Kent, I always felt the two personas were basically the same on &lt;i&gt;Lois &#038; Clark&lt;/i&gt; - making the Superman disguise (as it was in the case of that show, rather than CK) less believable.

I would say generally the same about the George Reeves Superman vs. Kent, but that show was from a simpler time as well.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m with you... I thought the movie was just so so... I&#039;m all for suspending belief but there&#039;s one thing that always cracks me up in the Superman movies:

1. a guy from another planet (no problem)
2. a guy that can fly (cool)
3. a guy with xray vision (fair enough)
4. a guy with superhuman strength (yup)
5. a guy whose only disguise is a pair of prescription glasses yet nobody catches on (I just can&#039;t get over it, it&#039;s so preposterous!)]]></description>
