					<description><![CDATA[Uhm, i&#039;m using your old one and using with CakePHP, it&#039;s been behaved quite good so far. I&#039;m loving it. I also spent hours to write a CakePHP helper for your EditInPlace js.

Thanks for your brilliant work! Cheers]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have the same issue. The problem is when the mouse moves from my  to a  element inside of the  the mouseout event gets trigger. I&#039;m trying to figure out a solution that doesn&#039;t require handling mousemove messages and checking if the pointer is inside the div. If you can figure it out that would make me happy because I&#039;m inherently lazy ;)

Thanks for your work on EditInPlace... it&#039;s much appreciated.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Joseph,
I have noticed that EditInPlace behaves strangely when there are HTML tags embedded within the moused-over text. For example, if I have a paragraph with some parts italicized, the italicized portions do not respond to a mouseover or mouseclick event in Firefox. IE throws an error. Have you seen that at all?

Thanks,
Darrin]]></description>
