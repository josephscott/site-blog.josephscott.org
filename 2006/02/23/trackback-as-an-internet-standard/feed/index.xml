					<description><![CDATA[Trackback is quite vulnerable to spam, but I haven&#039;t seen much Pingback spam around.  I believe the reason for this is that the Pingback specification recommends that Pingback servers check the page being submitted for links to the article in question.  This raises the bar for spammers - not by a large amount, but enough that it&#039;s just easier to spam Trackback instead.

Spam was in fact the explicit reason for this spec text, as you can see from the very first version of the spec:
http://www.kryogenix.org/writings/tech/pingback

It was discussed more on the mailing list here:
http://www.aquarionics.com/misc/archives/blogite/0287.html

A host whitelist with manual approval of the rest seems like it would solve the problem once and for all.  You could even build it semi-automatically by hooking in blogrolls, articles you link to, etc.

In hindsight, there&#039;s a lot to be improved with both Trackback and Pingback, so neither make a good candidate for a standard.  This recent turn of events seems centred around &quot;standardising Trackback&quot;, but in essense, it&#039;s really building a successor to both Trackback and Pingback.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Is trackback spam REALLY that much of a problem though? I mean, I have had my fair share of trackbacks that weren&#039;t really relevant but it pales in comparison to those automated programs that put a comment on your blog.

But, hey if you could come up with a way to do trackbaks without any spam I&#039;d be all for it.]]></description>
