You do not need a SS card as a child, but considering the benefits, there is little to no reason to not get it right away--as a baby.  As for the signature question: Parents do not sign for their child; and it doesn't need to be signed by the child until they are 18 or they gets a job first.  All of this has already been stated a few times by the others lol.  Thanks Amy, Erica, and Earthgal.",

For a child it is needed because you need the number to claim them as a dependent on an income tax return, to buy savings bonds for the child, to get medical coverage for the child and to apply for government services for the child. If you wait to get it once the child leaves the hospital after birth the process is longer and drawn out because the birth certificate needs to be varified and there are many other reasons why it is drawn out.",
