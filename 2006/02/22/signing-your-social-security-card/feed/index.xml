					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the help. I guess I&#039;ll request a replacement and then have her sign it when she starts work.  In response to Hank&#039;s comment, I got our daughter a delayed birth certificate after her dad passed away , as I needed to apply for benefits for her. It is a huge ordeal. Took about  5 months. Getting a ss# when you haven&#039;t had one takes about 3 months.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Related question: I signed my SS card at like 16 or so--before I had a set signature. Since then I developed an actual one and it&#039;s nothing like the one on my SS card. Anyone know if this would be an issue? Will this be an issue for jobs if the signature on my card doesnt match the signature that I sign paperwork with? If so, should I get a new one and then use my &quot;real&quot;/current signature?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Sean, just in case there&#039;s a misunderstanding, there are actually several reasons for a child to get a SS card.  You do not need a SS card as a child, but considering the benefits, there is little to no reason to not get it right away--as a baby.  As for the signature question: Parents do not sign for their child; and it doesn&#039;t need to be signed by the child until they are 18 or they gets a job first.  All of this has already been stated a few times by the others lol.  Thanks Amy, Erica, and Earthgal.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Ok so I got on the social security website and consulted a professor since I am a social work student and the child does not need a social security card at birth but the way the government has it it&#039;s almost like you need one. For a child it is needed because you need the number to claim them as a dependent on an income tax return, to buy savings bonds for the child, to get medical coverage for the child and to apply for government services for the child. If you wait to get it once the child leaves the hospital after birth the process is longer and drawn out because the birth certificate needs to be varified and there are many other reasons why it is drawn out.]]></description>
