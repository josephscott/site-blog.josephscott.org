Also a months-long cycle where every new feature (object cache, usermeta, etc) was discussed on wp-hackers. There were thousands of people running nightlies, apparently none of them plugin authors. ;)\n\nHowever despite all that, there were still lots of plugin compatibility probs with 2.0. I think some of this might just be user error, they don't know when something is new. An update notification in the core would be easy to add and not cause any security problems.",
