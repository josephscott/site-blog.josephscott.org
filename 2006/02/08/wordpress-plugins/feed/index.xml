					<description><![CDATA[There were 12 days between when we said the release was coming out, and when it did. Also a months-long cycle where every new feature (object cache, usermeta, etc) was discussed on wp-hackers. There were thousands of people running nightlies, apparently none of them plugin authors. ;)

However despite all that, there were still lots of plugin compatibility probs with 2.0. I think some of this might just be user error, they don&#039;t know when something is new. An update notification in the core would be easy to add and not cause any security problems.]]></description>
