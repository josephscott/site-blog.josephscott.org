					<description><![CDATA[Nikolaus #19,

LDAP sends thing in plain text on port 389 that is by protocol it has to send it clear text.  You have to enable SSL to stop that.

Thanks

					<description><![CDATA[Hi,
I tried this recipe on tb 2.0.19 on linux with a 2003R2 AD. At first I thought it doesn&#039;T work, but the integration in thunderbird seems only half-ready:

- addressbook can&#039;t query the directory and show the addresses in the overview
- addressbook doesn&#039;t send correct auth, when asking for offline download
- the first time password is asked for is while adding recipients to a new mail.
 BTW: the passwords are send in plain text!!

In this state it&#039;s not usable for me. I will file bugs for LDAP support in TB.

Hope that helps...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello
Maybe someone know how to edit contacts on LDAP server (AD) from Outlook.
I can list contacts but can not update or add new one.
Via AD users and Computers this task is unproblematic - i delagate control to add and change contact objects.

Regards
Rafal]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This works for OS X 10.5 (Leopard) in both addressbook and mail.app:

For the search base, capitalization counts: CN=Users,DC=company,DC=com

For the username, use your email address:me@company.com

After modifying the search base and username, the directions in this article worked great!

However, with Snow Leopard, this will no longer be an issue as Exchange support will be built-in.]]></description>
