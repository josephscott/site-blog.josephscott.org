					<description><![CDATA[You know, I think you are right. I believe the nofollow movement is a big failure. It really doesnÂ’t prevent spam because most spam is done by auto bots. Spam detectors work much better at preventing spam. Autobots still hit sites that use the nofollow tag. I have also made my site a dofollow blog, because if someone is going to take the time to leave me a comment, I can at least pass them a little link juice ;)

FYI: Askimet has been very effective at stopping spam on my site.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think that the search engines need to explain their position on using re=nofollow on internal links.  I have seen a disturbing trend of webmasters using rel=nofollow on links on their own sites, thinking that they can control  what pages they want pagerank to not flow to.  Many folks are using rel=nofollow on links to pages on their site like &quot;privacy policy&quot; and &quot;about us.&quot;  Here is an example:www.restaurantica.com.

I think that this silly and counter-productive.  I also think that is fast way to ruin your own site.  Erroneously, some webmasters believe that this attribute can be used for SEO.   Some SEO types even advocate this policy. What do others think about this?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Funny - although one of my blogs has &#039;nofollow&#039; I&#039;m now getting 200 comments per day that are all spam. If I leave moderation more than 2 days the moderation page takes soooo long to load - people don&#039;t look for the nofollow tag. Sadly - so far every one of the comments is awful in nature, the most prurient content - I wouldn&#039;t even like my wife to read through the attemtion submissions. Could do with an easy plug-in to catch more.
