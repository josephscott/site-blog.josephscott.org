					<description><![CDATA[In agreement with what Christian said, since browsers throw-away CSS tags that they do not recognize I would not exactly categorize these as errors.  These errors that you are referring to are usually CSS tags that are not part of W3C CSS standard.  Different browsers have created their own CSS tags to allow certain features.  So as Christian said, sometimes programmers need to use &quot;dirty&quot; tricks in order to get their content to show up correctly across different browsers.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[When I found Firebug I couldn&#039;t believe I hadn&#039;t heard of it before.  I think maybe people just don&#039;t know it&#039;s out there.

I have been using it for awhile now though and I agree, it is indispensable.   Firefox is as well.  If I try and look for extensions for IE like this I either can&#039;t find them or they cost money or something.  If I had lots of money to spend on them I could waste my time trying to figure it out or just tell the visitors to the site to use Firefox instead if they have problems.

It is great because of the ability to create development tools that I can easily use like this.  Or you could even create your own if you had the time.  But why reinvent the wheel when theres good things right there on the Firefox extensions site.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;d guess that most of those errors in the sites tested are because of browser incompatability. In order to suffice all or most browsers you&#039;ll have to use &#039;dirty&#039; tricks, specially in CSS.

Since all the above sites seem to work pretty well, I wouldn&#039;t talk about errors as in &#039;wrong programming&#039;.]]></description>
