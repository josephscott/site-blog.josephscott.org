            "content_html": "Hi Joseph,  I realize this is super old, but I inherited a web app that's utilizing your EIP version 0.2.2 and they'd rather not rework everything, so I'm going with it.\n\nThe problem I'm having is that the selects are reordering the options based on the key of the key/value pairs provided.  In my case, the key is employee IDs and the value is employee name.  Since the name is what is displayed, I want it to be in order of the name.  Is there an option that will either change the auto-order to go off the value instead of the key, or just leave it in the order that they are added?\n\nThanks!",

With the textarea edit in place, do you think its possible to run it along side the the \"Dojo Editor widget\" (http://dojotoolkit.org/docs/rich_text.html)? The idea i'm playing with is having an initial prompt where the text area is allocated (click to add a description), then when they click it changes to the editor, they add a description, click save (which then writes to the db) and will then see it as normal text (should they want to come back and update the description). Obviously i'm thinking of potential issues which would prevent it from degrading gracefully or impact usability at all. What do you think? Am i barking mad? ;0) Any thoughts on this would be much appreciated..\nThanks,\nChris",
