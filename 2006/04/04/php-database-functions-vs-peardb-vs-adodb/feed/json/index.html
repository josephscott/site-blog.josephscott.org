It would be VERY interesting to know how the different libraries behave when dealing with 1000, 10000, 100000. This would allow you to draw very simple charts and have an idea of how the different systems deal with complexity...\n\nAnother interesting statistic would be: what is the amount of memory used by these systems?\n\nThank you for your work anyways ;-)\n\nRegards",

And if you are worried about performance, why even consider a host where you can't use something like APC or the ADOdb extension? Usually this means a dedicated server, something where you have a lot more control.\n\nYou tests showed ADOdb with APC improving by more than 700%, on the low end.  A good chunk of that is because of APC, since it doesn't have to re-compile the PHP scripts every time.  Which goes back to my point, using something APC offsets library size in a big way.  Not entirely, but much better than without it.\n\nIt seems obvious on the surface that ADOdb is probably not going to be as fast as PDO, I don't think anyone will find that surprising.\n\nIf you were looking to demonstrate performance issues, why didn't you include benchmarks for the mysql/mysqli functions?  Wouldn't those be even faster than PDO?\n\nJust a note on \"performance\" in general.  It isn't a substitute for scalability.  Not that improved performance isn't an important part of being scalable, but no amount of increased performance will make up for scalability.",

I suspect that PDO and ADOdb performance would be nearly a tie.\n\nI do have to disagree that the overhead to import code is small - as my tests showed, even with APC enabled, ADODdb performed at a bit less than half the speed of ADOdb. And since many hosting environments offer neither APC or the ADOdb extension, ADOdb is going to use a great deal more resources in most cases... so it should be a concern where performance is an issue.\n\nUltimately, my tests were to determine if there is it was an advantage or a disadvantage to add a large distribution such as the ADOdb library, and I understand that your tests were targeted differently.",
