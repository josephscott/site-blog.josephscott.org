					<description><![CDATA[I served with your brother in law here in Portugal. I love his sense of humor, and the genuine love he showed for everyone with whom he interacted in the mission field, and I´m sure he´s still spreading that love in the spiritual world!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Mr. Scott,

My sister-in-law, Annette Hallmark, was also killed in the accident that your brother-in-law was in.  I simply wish to tell you that I am sorry for your family&#039;s loss.  Annette was a wonderful woman and mother, and although we find it hard to carry on without her, I find comfort in knowing this accident was, although something near infathomable for us, God&#039;s plan for these three souls, and I hope your family finds comfort in your faith and love.]]></description>
