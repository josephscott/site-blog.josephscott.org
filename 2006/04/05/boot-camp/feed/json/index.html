            "content_html": "Yep, I think this will definitely help Apple sell more hardware, and coincidentally get more people exposed to Mac OSX. I started mentioning this to my wife tonight, and she was totally jazzed about the idea. She had heard something about it on the radio earlier today (on NPR I think).\n\nShe was very hip to replacing her current (Windows) system with an Intel Mac. She's not very partisan about the O/S--her only concern is being able to run some specific apps for her quilting business. I'm pretty sure that once she got familiar with OSX, she would prefer to do as much as possible with it, and that would actually be quite a bit: email, web browsing, and Office covers over 90% of her usage. She'd still need Windows for her embroidery software and Electric Quilter, but it's a tiny minority of her usage.",
