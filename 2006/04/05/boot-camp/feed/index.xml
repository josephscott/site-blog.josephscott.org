					<description><![CDATA[Yep, I think this will definitely help Apple sell more hardware, and coincidentally get more people exposed to Mac OSX. I started mentioning this to my wife tonight, and she was totally jazzed about the idea. She had heard something about it on the radio earlier today (on NPR I think).

She was very hip to replacing her current (Windows) system with an Intel Mac. She&#039;s not very partisan about the O/S--her only concern is being able to run some specific apps for her quilting business. I&#039;m pretty sure that once she got familiar with OSX, she would prefer to do as much as possible with it, and that would actually be quite a bit: email, web browsing, and Office covers over 90% of her usage. She&#039;d still need Windows for her embroidery software and Electric Quilter, but it&#039;s a tiny minority of her usage.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve seen this story and for what it is possible to see from the first installations of Windows on Macs out there, it isn&#039;t possible yet to use Base Camp to boot anything else than Windows Home/Professional SP2.

But I supose that Linux or FreBSD or OpenSolaris will eventually be bootable via Boot Camp. Let&#039;s Hope.]]></description>
