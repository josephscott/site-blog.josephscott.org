					<description><![CDATA[Okay.  I am so greatfull to have found someone that has gone through what I went through.  I&#039;ve had a few turtles in a small pond in my back yard before and the pond in&#039;st so easy for a turtle to get out of, or at least that is what I though, not unless they could crawl out of there, but that would be like a huge rock climb mission for them.  They end up missing the following morning.  They only make it through the daylight, and then once night comes i guess they escape.  I don&#039;t understand how.  I would at least think that i could still find them in the yard the next morning still trying to escape since they are known to be slow, and my yard is pretty big,  but there is now sign of them any where.  It&#039;s too mind blowing for me.  I&#039;m just giving up on turtles.  i have also wondered if they dig tunnels.]]></description>
