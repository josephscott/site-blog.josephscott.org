If Akismet doesn&#039;t work for you, give &lt;a href=&quot;http://unknowngenius.com/blog/wordpress/spam-karma/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;SpamKarma2&lt;/a&gt; a try. It&#039;s proven to be nearly 100% accurate for me--I&#039;ve had to eyeball a half dozen moderated comments (all spam), with one false positive (which was easily rescued). So far, no spam has slipped through.]]></description>
