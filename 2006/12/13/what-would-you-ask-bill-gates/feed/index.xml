					<description><![CDATA[Dear Mr. Gates;
Have you ever considered trying to set up a large organization that would save/help all the homeless people(many being veterans of USA)?
Since you have so much power and a large money volume, you could set up areas across the USA, to bring in the homeless, have them receive medical and dental exams, clean them up, dress them up, have them go through a
spiritual uplifting and a mental uplifting to gradually help them with a transittion back into society.
Please consider this project, which is desperately needed at this time in the USA.
With open hearts and open minds, you and your teams of assistants, can make such a big change in our current suffering world!
God BLess and keep up all the wonderful projects !
Sincerely,
Linda Miller]]></description>
