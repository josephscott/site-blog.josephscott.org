					<description><![CDATA[Dreamhost won&#039;t ever (repeat EVER) let you use those monthly figures. Have a high bandwidth website? Go with Amazon. Dreamhost will shut you down and hold your data hostage long before you reach the limits on your account.

They work like this: Advertise outrages low prices for storage/bandwidth - consumer is like &quot;OMG YEA! they&#039;re offering more than xyz company for much less! - I&#039;ll choose nightmarehost&quot;. Then your typical customer only uses 1gig of network traffic a month and 20mb of disk space.(Key take away: Nightmare hosts profits.)

Now this might be fine, lets say you&#039;re a business startup.. hey this is great, no problems for my first 6 months because we&#039;re just getting started... oh look we&#039;re getting popular, our traffic is increasing steadily and i&#039;m on the way to using 60% of my allocated resources for this month -- then BAM nightmare host shuts you down because the amount of traffic you&#039;re receiving is effecting its low usage customers that have the SAME service... you provide the math showing you&#039;ll never consume the resources they have promised in the timeframe.... too bad so sad bye bye.

Your business fails because they wont allow you to access the data stored on their servers, customers cant access your website. And guess what, they won&#039;t delete your data from their servers... upon requesting numerous times over several months until you give up because you cant afford to hire a lawyer and they know it (as why else would you buy into snake oil like that)

Nightmarehost... don&#039;t do it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The details of my experience with Dreamhost vs S3 are detailed here:
http://macrolinz.com/macrolinz/index.php/2008/04/25/dreamhosts-500gb-hosting-really-is-a-dream/

Long story short, you can&#039;t actually use the 500+GB at Dreamhost so Amazon S3 is the winner.

As for using S3Drive for Subversion on S3, it won&#039;t work.  It doesn&#039;t cache the files locally which is something Subversion needs to work.  JungleDisk does cache and you can set up a repository that works, but it&#039;s not free and you can&#039;t access the data in your buckets without it (so if the tool goes away you&#039;ll have a tough time).  I&#039;m looking into other options myself.]]></description>
