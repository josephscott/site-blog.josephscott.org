Then your typical customer only uses 1gig of network traffic a month and 20mb of disk space.(Key take away: Nightmare hosts profits.)\n\nNow this might be fine, lets say you're a business startup.. hey this is great, no problems for my first 6 months because we're just getting started... oh look we're getting popular, our traffic is increasing steadily and i'm on the way to using 60% of my allocated resources for this month -- then BAM nightmare host shuts you down because the amount of traffic you're receiving is effecting its low usage customers that have the SAME service... you provide the math showing you'll never consume the resources they have promised in the timeframe.... too bad so sad bye bye.\n\nYour business fails because they wont allow you to access the data stored on their servers, customers cant access your website. And guess what, they won't delete your data from their servers... upon requesting numerous times over several months until you give up because you cant afford to hire a lawyer and they know it (as why else would you buy into snake oil like that)\n\nNightmarehost... don't do it.",

It doesn't cache the files locally which is something Subversion needs to work.  JungleDisk does cache and you can set up a repository that works, but it's not free and you can't access the data in your buckets without it (so if the tool goes away you'll have a tough time).
