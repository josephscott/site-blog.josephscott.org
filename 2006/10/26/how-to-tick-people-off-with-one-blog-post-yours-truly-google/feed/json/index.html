Google is a trademark and unless they want their trademark to go the way of the zipper and the other trademarks mentioned in the blog, they HAVE to take regular steps to steer us users in the correct direction.\n\nAdobe, on the other hand, in trying to do the same thing, comes across as nit-picking.  Unless the identity of the specific photo editing software product used is absolutely essential to the sentence, a writer is more likely to eliminate the reference to \"Photoshop\" entirely rather than use the laughable sentences Abode constructed.  I can't imagine Matsushita or General Motors telling people that they could not use Panasonic or Pontiac without putting the company name in front of the trademark.",
