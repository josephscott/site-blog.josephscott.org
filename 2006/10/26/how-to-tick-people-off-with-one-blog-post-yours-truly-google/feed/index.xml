					<description><![CDATA[I agree with Mike, Jose and particularly Scott.  Google is a trademark and unless they want their trademark to go the way of the zipper and the other trademarks mentioned in the blog, they HAVE to take regular steps to steer us users in the correct direction.

Adobe, on the other hand, in trying to do the same thing, comes across as nit-picking.  Unless the identity of the specific photo editing software product used is absolutely essential to the sentence, a writer is more likely to eliminate the reference to &quot;Photoshop&quot; entirely rather than use the laughable sentences Abode constructed.  I can&#039;t imagine Matsushita or General Motors telling people that they could not use Panasonic or Pontiac without putting the company name in front of the trademark.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Half the world seems to have over-reacted to this.  I don&#039;t blame Google at all and I thought the post was rather light-hearted.

					<description><![CDATA[I totally disagree 100%.  I don&#039;t think this was offensive in any way.  Not only do I think they communicated effectively but in a humorously fun way.  Good for them.  I&#039;d hate to have my billion-dollar brand name inappropriately linked to their competitor&#039;s products.]]></description>
