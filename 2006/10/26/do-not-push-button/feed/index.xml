					<description><![CDATA[A follow up/confession...I have pushed it more than once when no one is around...actually a couple times when there where others present....Hey! It&#039;s RED, how can I help not to push it! On the down side, nothing seemed to go faster afterwards.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I still think releasing the tiger when the button is pushed is the way to go. And, you&#039;re right...I don&#039;t think they could have come up with a more tempting/conspicuous spot, color and size. After all, who doesn&#039;t want to hit a big red button with &quot;PUSH&quot; clearly stamped on it regardless of what some wall plaque says. Oh, and btw where the heck did they get such a gargantuan button?]]></description>
