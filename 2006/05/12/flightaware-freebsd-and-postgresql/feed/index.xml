					<description><![CDATA[[...] First up, I&#8217;ll pick on my own site. We&#8217;ll take my entry on FlightAware: FreeBSD and PostgreSQL as an example. You&#8217;ll see the red circle come up and indicate that there are 4 errors. If you dig into those errors you&#8217;ll find that they are from the Google AdSense ads on the site. Unfortunately the code causing the errors is inserted by the Google ads when the page is loaded, so there doesn&#8217;t seem to be much that I can do about that. I may try to chance the style of ads to see if I can make it work later on. [...]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The 40M inserts per day is accurate, and you are correct that at peak times it&#039;s much greater than 460 inserts per second.  This is what we use the memory resident database for -- to provide a rapid way to store it and to rapidly provide query results for aircraft in-flight and generate the track logs to the map servers, etc.

Once a flight completes or certain other conditions are met, the flight track is logged to the PostgreSQL database, but as a single transaction.  So for example a three hour flight might generate 200-300 position updates, but when the flight completes, those are stored in the database as a single insert, and we let PostgreSQL&#039;s &quot;toast&quot; system efficiently handle the somewhat oversized record.

As to the six minute delay, five minutes of that are intentionally added upstream by the FAA.  Latencies transmitting and receiving the data and then decoding, interpreting, and processing it takes a little less than a minute.]]></description>
