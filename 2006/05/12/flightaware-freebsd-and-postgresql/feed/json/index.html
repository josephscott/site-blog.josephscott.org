So for example a three hour flight might generate 200-300 position updates, but when the flight completes, those are stored in the database as a single insert, and we let PostgreSQL's \"toast\" system efficiently handle the somewhat oversized record.\n\nAs to the six minute delay, five minutes of that are intentionally added upstream by the FAA.
