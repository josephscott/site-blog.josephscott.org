					<description><![CDATA[The most interesting thing about EC3 is that they&#039;ve set a stake in the ground for pay-as-you-go pricing. They&#039;re not the first, UtilityServe had a similar announcement the week before.

To &quot;take over the world&quot; as you mention above they&#039;ll need to go up the stack an deal with the issue of how developers integrate these images into interesting applications. That area of technology IS rocket science and there are a number of companies diligently pushing the frontier forward.]]></description>
