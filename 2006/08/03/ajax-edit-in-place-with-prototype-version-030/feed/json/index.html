Use Prototype's Object.extend(default, options); This will map all passed in options over the default options leaving an updated default object. Also, change the EditInPlace = function() {} to just EditInPlace = {}. The first version is classable and multiple EditInPlace's could be instantiated. Whereas, it looks like you just want a single object from which each item is \"MadeEditable\". Although, it might make more sense to make EditInPlace a class object from which each instantiation would do the same as makeEditable and through which you could pass in your options, instead of what you seem to be doing which is storing each new editable items options in an array.\n\nAnyways, just some initial thoughts.
