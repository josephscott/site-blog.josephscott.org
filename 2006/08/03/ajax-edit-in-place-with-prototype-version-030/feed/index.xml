If there is an easier way (i.e. passing variables directly through the javascript calls) let me know please.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[i got this great script implemented pretty quickly on a new website i&#039;m working on,but i need to customize it a bit to send the edits to a database. I&#039;ve been fooling with edit.php, but to update the database I need to pass more information (like the primary key) to edit.php. I&#039;ve tried to add session variables and fooled with EditInPlace.js some, but to no avail.
There has got to be an easy way to send some arguments, now stored in PHP variables from my calling page, to edit.php, right?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Just a quickie to say that I&#039;ve been playing around with EditInPlace for a few days now, and have added some basic Moo.fx transitions to the saving process. Someone might want to use this as inspiration for enhancing the script further, but for now, I&#039;m happy with some basic effects.

					<description><![CDATA[Joseph, thank you &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; much for this. It&#039;s fantastic! I&#039;m sitting down today and playing around with styling and some scriptaculous effects if I have the time. A simple improvment is adding an animation image as the saving_text string. I took the &quot;arrows&quot; indicator for &lt;a&gt;Ajaxload&lt;/a&gt; and it really looks the part!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Dries,

I think the idea here is to have the update page one that actually updates a database - that way the content of the editable area will be updated when the user returns. Joseph&#039;s just put together a quick example of how it works :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is a great code!
Thanks alot!
I think it would be really cool if it is possible that text is saved in the users cookies, zo it is still edited when he comes back to the page, like it is now, the text is back to default then.
Somebody tryed to figure that out allready?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I haven&#039;t had much time to look through it but I&#039;ve come across one way you could optimize some of your code: you have an options object literal, which you loop through to assign each value to an internal array. Use Prototype&#039;s Object.extend(default, options); This will map all passed in options over the default options leaving an updated default object. Also, change the EditInPlace = function() {} to just EditInPlace = {}. The first version is classable and multiple EditInPlace&#039;s could be instantiated. Whereas, it looks like you just want a single object from which each item is &quot;MadeEditable&quot;. Although, it might make more sense to make EditInPlace a class object from which each instantiation would do the same as makeEditable and through which you could pass in your options, instead of what you seem to be doing which is storing each new editable items options in an array.

Anyways, just some initial thoughts. Thanks for continuing to work on this. :)]]></description>
