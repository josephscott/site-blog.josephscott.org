					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the positive review, Joseph.

When you subscribe to a feed, Feed Crier starts watching that feed for updates. Only feeds with an active subscription are monitored. Using hueristics to determine the best polling frequency, Feed Crier can send you an update within minutes of it being posted online. The goal is to reduce this to seconds.

Although you&#039;re not a big IM user, you might still find this useful. Many applications and web sites are creating alerts via IM now. If you need to stay on top of those in real time, email or a feed reader often doesn&#039;t cut it.]]></description>
