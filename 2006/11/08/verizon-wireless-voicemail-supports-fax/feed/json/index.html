The other is Enhanced Voice Mail and she said that it was $4.95/month.  She did say that if it's something I only need occasionally that I could add it at the time I need it.  So, I can't try it out.\n\nIs there any other way around this?  All of you seem to have it functioning just fine.",

            "content_html": "I just tried it today. I have enhanced voicemail so can't say if it would work without it, but by default, it assumes you are calling your voicemail from a fax machine. It uses caller id on the fax machine and forwards the fax to the machine you are calling from. If you are not calling from a fax machine, you can choose a number to fax to. I had to try 4 times to get it to take the number, first try i did 10 digits, 2nd two tries I did 1+10digits, third try i did 10 digits and it worked. So either i typo'ed the first time, and you do not dial 1 first, or there is a timing issue. I suspect a timing issue, because I've run into them in other parts of their menu system. I suggest waiting until after it is finished asking you to enter the new phone number, and leisurely enter the number in without a 1 prefix.\n\n--Tim C",
