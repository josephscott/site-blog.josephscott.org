					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m not sure how I stumbled upon this site but it started when I was trying to find out the French pronunciation of Bourbonnais, IL. I lived there for quite a while and pronounce it BUR-bun-ay but some older locals say bur-BONE-us. I&#039;ve always been fascinated by everything Australia-related and I really thought that I was correctly pronouncing it as MEL-burn. Now I know. Thanks.

PS I&#039;ve been to Melbourne in Florida which is of course said the American way.

PPS It is Colombia for the South American country.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Scott,

While your point certainly carries merit for pronouncing YOUR name, it holds little weight in the Australian context.  Cities must be pronounced with their regional context in mind.  For example, I&#039;m from New Jersey.  We have a town called Bogota that&#039;s about an hour from me.  Here in New Jersey, we pronounce it Ba-goatta.  Clearly, our pronunciation is quite different from the pronunciation that&#039;s used in Columbia.  It&#039;s rather simple: in reference to the Columbian capital, one must use the Columbian pronunciation; in reference to the New Jersey city, one must use the Jersey pronunciation.

The same logic applies here.  Although you may consider the Australian pronunciation a bastardization of your name, it is the only correct pronunciation of the Australian city.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I just stumbled upon this post, and as an American with the name &quot;Melbourne&quot; find it quite interesting.

					<description><![CDATA[Okay, just to play devil‚Äôs advocate dictionary.com shows it as Mel-bern and m-w.com as Mel-b&#038;rn and upon clicking on the cute little speaker icon it pronounces it ‚Äúmel-burn‚Äù. So it would seem to be grammatically correct to pronounce it that way, even if we Americans don‚Äôt have the proper accent or aren&#039;t adept with regional phonetics to drop the ‚ÄúR‚Äù.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[wioota-

I usually just let it slide, but this kept poking at me.  So I finally had to stand up and say something :-)

I lived in various parts of Melbourne as a missionary for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lds.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;The Church of Jesus Chris of Latter-day Saints&lt;/a&gt; from 1992 to 1994.  Happy to see that Nutella is easy to get in the U.S. now, don&#039;t miss Vegemite :-)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks Joseph - this is practically a Community Announcement! Hopefully your fellow Americans will benefit from greater cooperation with any Aussies that cross their paths armed with this new knowledge. It can really put you offside when someone greets you with &quot;Oh, your from Mel-borrrn! I&#039;ve been to Ossssie!!&quot; (Although I find its television shows such as &#039;Entertainment Tonight&#039; which are the far more frequent offenders).

What brought you to Melbourne for those two years?]]></description>
