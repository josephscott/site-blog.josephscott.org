            "content_html": "Scott,\n\nWhile your point certainly carries merit for pronouncing YOUR name, it holds little weight in the Australian context.  Cities must be pronounced with their regional context in mind.  For example, I'm from New Jersey.  We have a town called Bogota that's about an hour from me.  Here in New Jersey, we pronounce it Ba-goatta.  Clearly, our pronunciation is quite different from the pronunciation that's used in Columbia.  It's rather simple: in reference to the Columbian capital, one must use the Columbian pronunciation; in reference to the New Jersey city, one must use the Jersey pronunciation.\n\nThe same logic applies here.  Although you may consider the Australian pronunciation a bastardization of your name, it is the only correct pronunciation of the Australian city.",
