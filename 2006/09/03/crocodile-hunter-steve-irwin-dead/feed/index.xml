					<description><![CDATA[Every once in a while a physical form leaves us to return to the spirit - An enormous influence and enlightening soul that no matter what your outside color - the loss will pull on your heart string - What is sad is that we all must mourn together, to come together - Steve Irwin has served his purpose and taught us a lesson.

The lesson is to not be afraid of any creature that dwells among us - To embrace, appreciate and Love them all.
But be wise and don&#039;t get too Damn Close!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My children and I have watched him pick up a dangerous Tarantula, saw him jump into that croc-infested pool of water and screamed as he stroked that dangerous cobra, worm and whatnot, right here on our living room couch.

We saw Steve perform all that, in that &#039;bubbly&#039; nature, exuding that &#039;Aussie accent&#039; that is so peculiarly his, altho&#039; spoken by so many others in his homeland that we have taken it for granted that the next time we tune in for some more of his entertaining &#038; enlightening programmes he will still be there for us.

Here by the way, means good old sunny - Malaysia, where like everywhere else in the world he has reached out &#038; touched everyone of us &#038; spread his message on Conservation &#038; Love for God&#039;s creation, wherever &#038; everywhere in the world today.

He has done it so effectively, threw down that barrier called creed, race, religion, ethnicities, beliefs, politics simply by being himself &#038; doing what he loves best.

We will All Miss his Presence &#038; will Never Forget Him in our lives - Ever.

					<description><![CDATA[What I find remarkable about this is that he actually died doing what he was famous for, which turned out to be dangerous after all.

A guy like this -- you tend to think (1) he&#039;d die in a car accident or some other mundane incident, and (2) the stuff he does on TV is so controlled that he&#039;s not in any real danger.

Well, surprise -- he did do dangerous stuff, and apparently it could kill him.  Steve, I&#039;m sorry for all the jokes I made at your expense.  Apparently you *were* a total badass after all.

The only justice here is that he died doing what he loved.]]></description>
