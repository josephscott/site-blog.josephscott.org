					<description><![CDATA[Using IIS and IE8. Had same problem where the csv would not open. It worked for years but when I added code to make my site IE10 compliant (in my case I told the browser to act like it was IE8, way too much code to change to make it truly IE10). Anyway the problem occured and the post from &quot;Harry School&quot; on (Fri 1 Dec 2006 at 4:39 am) worked for me.

My asp file has this in it and it works fine now.

Response.ContentType = &quot;application/octet-stream&quot;
Response.AddHeader &quot;content-disposition&quot;,&quot;attachment; filename=&quot; &#038; sfile &#038; &quot;.CSV&quot;
Response.CacheControl = &quot;Cache-Control: must-revalidate, post-check=0, pre-check=0&quot;

I was missing the last line.

Thanks so much!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Sorry, I should have mentioned that it worked before but it doesn&#039;t now...
It works on my manager&#039;s laptop with his parasite-browser (sorry I don&#039;t know what else to call it - I believe this &quot;browser&quot; uses the IE-engine but runs its own interface)...

&#038; yes my default browser is IE (&#038; I thought that would help...)

Thanks in advance for anyone who&#039;s giving this some thought.
&#038; since I don&#039;t know much about coding, I thought this &quot;might be part of the puzzle&quot;.

Cheers.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi people, I might be shouting at the wrong crowd...

But I can&#039;t get IE&#039;s authentication to &quot;carry over&quot; to Excel&#039;s web query, could any of you coders help please?

Thanks.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Guys, thanks everyone for the ideas. I tried various combinations. Finally, the below code worked and saved me from more agony. Many thanks to Harry School &#038; Duncan. post-check=0 and pre-check=0 did the trick.

        header(&quot;Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=filenamehere.csv;&quot;);
        header(&quot;Content-Type: text/csv&quot;);
        
        if(strpos($_SERVER[&#039;HTTP_USER_AGENT&#039;], &#039;MSIE&#039;)) 
        {
            header(&#039;Cache-Control: must-revalidate, post-check=0, pre-check=0&#039;);
            header(&#039;Pragma: public&#039;);
        } 
        else 
        {
            header(&#039;Pragma: no-cache&#039;);

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks Duncan, your method works for my site which uses SSL that annoys the crap out of me. For both IE and FF&#062; :) Whee now I can work better!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m still having trouble after looking through and trying your suggestion and those in the comments. I&#039;m running ASP.NET 2.0, IIS, Win2003.

I&#039;m generating a CSV file for users to download when they click a button on a page (the page is SiteReports.aspx). Without SSL, it works great in FF and IE7. With SSL (which I need to do), it works great in FF, but in IE7:

-&#062; If I have ContentType set to &#039;application/octet-stream&#039;, I get a file download prompt, but the filename I gave it is replaced with &#039;SiteReports_aspx&#039;, with no extension, so if they user chooses &#039;open&#039; from the download prompt, it opens as plain text within IE.
-&#062; If I have ContentType set to anything else, I get &#039;Internet Explorer cannot download SiteReports.aspx from etc...&#039;.

I don&#039;t understand why it tries to download something with a different filename than the one I specified in Content-Disposition. I&#039;m currently setting up my headers like this:

Response.Clear();
Response.Charset = String.Empty;
Response.ContentType = &quot;application/octet-stream&quot;;
Response.AddHeader(&quot;Pragma&quot;, &quot;public&quot;);
Response.AddHeader(&quot;Cache-Control&quot;, &quot;max-age=10&quot;);
Response.AddHeader(&quot;Content-Disposition&quot;, &quot;attachment; filename=test.csv&quot;);
Response.Write(fileContents);
Response.End();

Any ideas? Thanks.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[thanks for that. additionally the particular IE&#039;s here are only happy if content-type header offers encoding=... as well.

e.g.
header(&#039;Content-type: application/octet-stream; encoding=UTF-8&#039;);]]></description>
