I'm running ASP.NET 2.0, IIS, Win2003.\n\nI'm generating a CSV file for users to download when they click a button on a page (the page is SiteReports.aspx). Without SSL, it works great in FF and IE7. With SSL (which I need to do), it works great in FF, but in IE7:\n\n-&gt; If I have ContentType set to 'application/octet-stream', I get a file download prompt, but the filename I gave it is replaced with 'SiteReports_aspx', with no extension, so if they user chooses 'open' from the download prompt, it opens as plain text within IE.\n-&gt; If I have ContentType set to anything else, I get 'Internet Explorer cannot download SiteReports.aspx from etc...'.\n\nI don't understand why it tries to download something with a different filename than the one I specified in Content-Disposition. I'm currently setting up my headers like this:\n\nResponse.Clear();\nResponse.Charset = String.Empty;\nResponse.ContentType = \"application/octet-stream\";\nResponse.AddHeader(\"Pragma\", \"public\");\nResponse.AddHeader(\"Cache-Control\", \"max-age=10\");\nResponse.AddHeader(\"Content-Disposition\", \"attachment; filename=test.csv\");\nResponse.Write(fileContents);\nResponse.End();\n\nAny ideas?
