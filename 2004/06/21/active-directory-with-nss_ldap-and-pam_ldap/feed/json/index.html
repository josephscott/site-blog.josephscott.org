Since then Winbind seems to be quite stable on FreeBSD and with the idmap_rid option you can easily keep the UID to SID mapping consistent across multiple systems. With the release of FreeBSD 6.0 this month I&#8217;m ready to update the steps needed to make FreeBSD use Active Directory (AD) users and groups, this time via Samba (Winbind) instead of LDAP.
