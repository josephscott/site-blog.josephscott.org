					<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t think ’select 11/5;’ should be considered Integer math and yes, I would expect 2.2.  Yes, 11 and 5 are integers but that doesn&#039;t mean anything, even floats are integers sometimes.  Now, if you typed &#039;select `col_a` / `col_b`;&#039; and both col_a and col_b were integer types then sure, the result should be 2.  Likewise if  one uses a function which is defined as being an integer function then I would expect an integer.

The round behavior is odd though, I would expect a default of rounding to the nearest with an option to specify round up/down if preffered.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In answer to Mark Stosberg&#039;s comment on why its not the expected result is because integer maths normally always return an integer, and if your expecting an integer and get a floating point number problems can occur. If you want a real answer then you use floating point maths.  That rounding issue is rather more scary to me...viva la piggy-squeal (pgsql)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have got such problems while trying to calculate the varege of a class, ans so I were obliged to do it with PHP code directly, now it seems that after two years I&#039;ve found the answer, I thought that I was a bug, but it&#039;s nothing else an other limit of MySql, postgresql is great anyway !]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Really?  I tried out bc with 11/5 and got 2.  With 11%5 I got 1, just like PostgreSQL did.  Again, the MySQL isn&#039;t wrong, for this case, just perhaps not what some would expect.  It is also inconsistent with their DIV() function, which I would expect to work the same way as the math operator of the same name.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Why are programmers more likely to expect the answer that PostgreSQL gives for division than MySQL? I would expect the MySQL answer myself, because it &#039;more accurate&#039; in the sense that it contains more significant digits. It&#039;s also the answer I get whenn using the &#039;bc&#039; command line calculator. (I&#039;m a programmer who prefers PostgreSQL).]]></description>
