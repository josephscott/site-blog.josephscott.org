Yes, 11 and 5 are integers but that doesn't mean anything, even floats are integers sometimes.  Now, if you typed 'select `col_a` / `col_b`;' and both col_a and col_b were integer types then sure, the result should be 2.  Likewise if  one uses a function which is defined as being an integer function then I would expect an integer.\n\nThe round behavior is odd though, I would expect a default of rounding to the nearest with an option to specify round up/down if preffered.",
