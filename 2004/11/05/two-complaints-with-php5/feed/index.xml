					<description><![CDATA[I think multiple inheritance is a near necessity for large scale applications. Sure, most people don&#039;t need it, but for some applications it is incredibly useful and helpful. Interfaces achieve an entirely different result, I don&#039;t know why people always say &quot;use interfaces instead&quot; that makes no sense to me.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I never suggested that multiple inheritance would be a free feature from a performance stand point.  I do contend though that abstract classes are not a substitute for multiple inheritance.

In addition to C++, multiple inheritance is supported by Perl, Python and Eiffel.  Likely more, but those are the ones I can think of off hand.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I was writing a kind of unit testing suite, but found out that PHP5 does not take PHP errors as exceptions. Just like you said. So I came accross your page by googling on the subject. This is very sad. I was just being amazed by the restore_exception_handler when this sh#t hit me. Thanks for the set_error_handler advice.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Actually, I don&#039;t think multiple inheritance is a must, sure it&#039;s a nice feature, but sometimes it gives painful headaches, and it&#039;s often misused and it got a bad reputation from those misuses. It probably took long sessions for Java designers to decide that Java doesn&#039;t need multiple inheritance, so we&#039;ll have to stick to the next best thing.]]></description>
