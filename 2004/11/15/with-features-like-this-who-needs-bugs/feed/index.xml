					<description><![CDATA[If I need integrity in mySQL I use InnoDB table type, it supports foreign keys, it&#039;s fine for me.

					<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s ok, its mySQL! Sure, it doesn&#039;t support basic relational features, and sure, the company kinda sorta misrepresents the GPL, but it sure is fast!

If you were interested in data integrity, you wouldn&#039;t be using mySQL anyway!]]></description>
