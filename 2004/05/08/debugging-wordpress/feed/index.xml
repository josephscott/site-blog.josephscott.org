					<description><![CDATA[Thank you very much, this snippet has helped me pinpointed the problem in my client&#039;s blog.

Turned out his database was corrupted, and tbale wp_options contained about 1,200,000 records. And I was wondering why his blog took forever to load :-)  apache/error.log, mysql/mysql.log, mysql/mysql-slow-queries.log, etc - none of them had the clue that I needed.

Thanks again, it was most helpful !]]></description>
