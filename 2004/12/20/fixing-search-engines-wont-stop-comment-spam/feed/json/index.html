You moderate because you want to protect your site from spam and trolls, but if you syndicate without moderating, this has no effect (as once an item is in BlogLines, or PubSub, it'll be there forever)... perhaps you could blame the weblog owners for that one ;-)",

The problem, of course, is that it is very difficult for us to determine what is and is not spam. One thing you can do, however, to reduce the amount of spam you get is to use PubSub LinkRanks to filter the results you get. Typically, the spam comes from sites that nobody links to. Thus, if you say you only want to get data from sites that are in the \"Top 50%\" according to LinkRanks, you won't see as much spam. Of course, you'll be missing other \"good\" data as well.
