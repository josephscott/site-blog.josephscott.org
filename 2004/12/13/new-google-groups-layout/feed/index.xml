					<description><![CDATA[I think the new layout has good points and it&#039;s bad points.

Firstly, the bad points - it is VERY VERY difficult to see the structure of posts in a thread, and this makes it difficult to follow.

The good point about the new layout is that it is very much quicker than before, now it&#039;s a case of waiting seconds to see your own posts whereas before it was a case of hours or overnight.

I&#039;m sure Google know what they are doing and it will improve re: the bad points.]]></description>
