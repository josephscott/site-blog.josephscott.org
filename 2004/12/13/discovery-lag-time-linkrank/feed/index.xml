					<description><![CDATA[Hi Joseph,
You are quite right about LinkRanks not being brand new, and many people skipped right by it when we first launched.  What is new, however, is the ability to track the history - that wasn&#039;t available before.

And yes, we could create some very cool graphs if only everyone put all the correct information on their blogs, including the blog hosters!  Information that is both structured and complete is one of the utopias to which we all aspire (that graph, though, is asymptotic, imho!)

Cheers,
Salim]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Sorry that this is totally unrelated to the rest of your post, but I say we should start using &quot;blogiverse&quot; over &quot;blogosphere&quot;. I can&#039;t stand &quot;blogosphere&quot;. I could live with &quot;blogiverse&quot;.

By the way, your wp-no-spam-comments-post.php thing stinks. I didn&#039;t fill out my e-mail address so I got an error message, but when I hit back to correct it my comment had been erased.]]></description>
