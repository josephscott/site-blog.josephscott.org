What is new, however, is the ability to track the history - that wasn't available before.\n\nAnd yes, we could create some very cool graphs if only everyone put all the correct information on their blogs, including the blog hosters!  Information that is both structured and complete is one of the utopias to which we all aspire (that graph, though, is asymptotic, imho!)\n\nCheers,\nSalim",
