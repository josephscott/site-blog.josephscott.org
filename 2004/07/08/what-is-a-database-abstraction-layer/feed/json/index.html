I've developed a simple database abstraction layer (SDBA) that cleanly separates DB-specific access functions and provides a *very* simple interface, aimed at productivity. Different implementations of SDBA for different databases are being worked on. The query function \"understands\" SQL queries and returns different things if its a SELECT, UPDATE, or INSERT. Let me know what you think. Here it is:\nhttp://www.morewhite.com/sdba",
