Along with restoring all of my data and applications I&#8217;ve been tweaking a few settings. In the past I&#8217;ve edited /etc/rc to adjust sysctl values. It turns out that Mac OS X (at least as of 10.3.4) supports using /etc/sysctl.conf to set sysctl values. Here&#8217;s what my /etc/sysctl.conf looks like:  kern.sysv.shmmax=167772160 kern.sysv.shmmin=1 kern.sysv.shmmni=64 kern.sysv.shmseg=16 kern.sysv.shmall=65536 kern.maxproc=2048 kern.maxprocperuid=512  Update (8:42am 7 Jul 04): Hmmm, even though there is clearly code in /etc/rc to set sysctl values from /etc/sysctl.conf they don&#8217;t appear to actually change the values. I guess for now I&#8217;ll be putting these values directly into /etc/rc again. If anyone has more info on this please leave a comment. [...]",
