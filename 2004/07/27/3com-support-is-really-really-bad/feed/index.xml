					<description><![CDATA[Do you know you can get the 3com Switch 3300 24 port on ebay for like $35 now?

I got on. I use it in my room. But the fans way to loud. I put the 2 fans to 5 volts not 12. But it was about as loud as a Xbox then. Today I just cut a bit 120mm hole in the top of it and put a fan blowin down. I don&#039;t hear it any more and the air comming out is not as worm was it was with the 2 bilts in fans at 5 volts that made sound still.

It took me about 4 hours to cut a neat hole in the top of it put mount a big fan.

But it&#039;s working super good. I wish it had a way to check what Temperature it is inside.

					<description><![CDATA[Having worked in 3Com support for a number of years I know how it works. Support within 3Com is seen operationally as a cost center, that is to say an area that will not make a profit. As a result of this it is always short on resource. As technology moves so fast, this isn&#039;t seen as a problem. You will be advised to upgrade to resolve your problem. If this involved a firmware upgrade you would often already have the firmware in your unit, we&#039;d just down load an unlock. Another trick we used was in product release, we&#039;d initially release a unit with a good chip set to allow the unit to get good reviews and take a foot hold, and after the first few shipments replace the good (more expensive) chips with cheaper ones that, of course, don&#039;t work as well. The end user would be blind to this. It&#039;s not just 3Com that do this, many manufacturers behave in the same way. This is what comes when you put profit above customer service.

Fundamentally, the products are as a result of the people, good people, happy workers etc make for good products. 3Com HR are in constant battle with employees, they see themselves as a protective layer separating the people from the company. As long as 3Com has poor HR, you will always get problems with their products.]]></description>
