I put the 2 fans to 5 volts not 12. But it was about as loud as a Xbox then. Today I just cut a bit 120mm hole in the top of it and put a fan blowin down. I don't hear it any more and the air comming out is not as worm was it was with the 2 bilts in fans at 5 volts that made sound still.\n\nIt took me about 4 hours to cut a neat hole in the top of it put mount a big fan.\n\nBut it's working super good. I wish it had a way to check what Temperature it is inside.\n\n-Raymond Day",

            "content_html": "Having worked in 3Com support for a number of years I know how it works. Support within 3Com is seen operationally as a cost center, that is to say an area that will not make a profit. As a result of this it is always short on resource. As technology moves so fast, this isn't seen as a problem. You will be advised to upgrade to resolve your problem. If this involved a firmware upgrade you would often already have the firmware in your unit, we'd just down load an unlock. Another trick we used was in product release, we'd initially release a unit with a good chip set to allow the unit to get good reviews and take a foot hold, and after the first few shipments replace the good (more expensive) chips with cheaper ones that, of course, don't work as well. The end user would be blind to this. It's not just 3Com that do this, many manufacturers behave in the same way. This is what comes when you put profit above customer service.\n\nFundamentally, the products are as a result of the people, good people, happy workers etc make for good products. 3Com HR are in constant battle with employees, they see themselves as a protective layer separating the people from the company. As long as 3Com has poor HR, you will always get problems with their products.",
