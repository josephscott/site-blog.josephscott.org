            "content_html": "Greeting folks. I will make this short as possible. First, I want to thank everyone for their post. \nI know absolutely nothing about coding or .htaccess files or anything else. I recently created an eCommerce site using OpenCart 2.0.1.0 and hosted it with FatCow. I purchased an SSL and learned in order for it to work with OpenCart I had to alter the config.php files at the root and in the admin folder &lt;&lt; (To make the admin panel SSL also). After altering the files I had trouble with my website. I could add items to the cart but, when I clicked on any link it would log the user out. If I reversed the changes to the config files the website worked fine except it wasn&#039;t SSL. While as said I knew nothing about coding I did suspect it had something to do with links not directing properly due to the SSL. So, I thought, what if I could find a way to make all the pages SSL. Would that resolve the issue? I didn&#039;t know but, I aimed to find out. Then while searching I came across this site and decided to gamble by entering one of the codes above. This is the code I inserted. \n\nRewriteEngine On\nRewriteCond %{HTTPS} off\nRewriteRule (.*) https://%{HTTP_HOST}%{REQUEST_URI} [R=301,L]\n\nSure enough. This resolved the issue. Now my entire site is SSL and no more user log outs. \n\nIn short, thank all of you for posting your ideas and solutions. Now it&#039;s time to make some money with the site.. Thanks again  ;-)",
