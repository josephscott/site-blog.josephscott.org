What specifc problems were you seeing?\n\nI'm guessing that when you added a search for your whole site, Blogdigger returned less results than expected.  This is related to what I mentioned in my previous comment; when I first built the link search app, I was focusing on tracking conversations between blog posts specifically, not general site links.  As such, Blogdigger's link search looks at the whole link.  As time went on I realized this needed improvement, and I've been working on a new version that should be in place soon.\n\nEither way, I'd appreciate any specific comments, it would help in improving Blogdigger.  Thanks!",
