					<description><![CDATA[Hi Joseph, I&#039;m sorry Blogdigger didn&#039;t work so well for you.  What specifc problems were you seeing?

I&#039;m guessing that when you added a search for your whole site, Blogdigger returned less results than expected.  This is related to what I mentioned in my previous comment; when I first built the link search app, I was focusing on tracking conversations between blog posts specifically, not general site links.  As such, Blogdigger&#039;s link search looks at the whole link.  As time went on I realized this needed improvement, and I&#039;ve been working on a new version that should be in place soon.

Either way, I&#039;d appreciate any specific comments, it would help in improving Blogdigger.  Thanks!]]></description>
