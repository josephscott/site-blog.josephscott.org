										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you haven&#8217;t been following the development of the <a href="http://jetpack.me/">Jetpack</a> WordPress plugin now is a good time to take a look.  Today brings the announcement of <a href="http://jetpack.me/2012/11/08/jetpack-2-0-publicize-to-facebook-twitter-linkedin-tumblr-post-by-email-photon-infinite-scroll/">Jetpack 2.0</a>, adding post by email, photon, and more.</p>
<p><strong>Post By Email</strong> is something that WordPress has had for some time, but most self hosted WordPress sites don&#8217;t bother with it.  Why?  Because it is a pain to setup and manage.  Jetpack 2.0 brings the features and simplicity of <a href="http://jetpack.me/support/post-by-email/">post by email</a> powered by WordPress.com to self hosted WordPress sites.</p>
<p>Jetpack has gradually been building up awesome abilities, it isn&#8217;t all about this 2.0 release.  One of the things I&#8217;m most impressed with came in the <a href="http://jetpack.me/2012/10/26/jetpack-1-9-toolbar-notifications/">1.9 release</a>: support for the <a href="http://developer.wordpress.com/docs/api/">WordPress.com REST API</a>.  What this means is that you can now use the WordPress.com REST API to communicate with all WordPress.com hosted sites <strong>AND</strong> Jetpack connected sites.  Let that sink in for a minute.</p>
<p>What does that look like?  You can try it out with this URL: <a href="https://public-api.wordpress.com/rest/v1/sites/josephscott.org">https://public-api.wordpress.com/rest/v1/sites/josephscott.org</a></p>
<p>You&#8217;ll get back something like:</p>
<pre>{
  "ID": 5190300,
  "name": "Joseph Scott",
  "description": "",
  "URL": "http://josephscott.org/",
  "meta": {
    "links": {
      "self": "https://public-api.wordpress.com/rest/v1/sites/5190300",
      "help": "https://public-api.wordpress.com/rest/v1/sites/5190300/help",
      "posts": "https://public-api.wordpress.com/rest/v1/sites/5190300/posts/",
      "comments": "https://public-api.wordpress.com/rest/v1/sites/5190300/comments/"
    }
  }
}</pre>
<p>Remember that josephscott.org is not hosted on WordPress.com.</p>
<p>Developers now have the potential of being able to use a single API end point for every WordPress site out there, it doesn&#8217;t matter if they are hosted on WordPress.com or some place else (assuming they connect with Jetpack).  Now that is impressive.</p>
