										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Toward the end of 2010 I really got the itch to experiment with new/different coding projects.  The first thing this led me to was to write an IRC bot.</p>
<p>While I use IRC daily, it has been years since I&#8217;ve been any deeper besides casual use.  So I started with writing a simple library to speak to IRC servers.  That didn&#8217;t hold my interest for very long, so I retired that code and started building on top of the <a href="http://pear.php.net/package/Net_SmartIRC/">Net_SmartIRC</a> package from <a href="http://pear.php.net/">Pear</a>.   I was writing this bot in <a href="http://php.net/">PHP</a>, in part because I wanted to play with a few new language feature, specifically &#8211; <a href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/functions.anonymous.php">anonymous functions</a>.  More on those in a minute.</p>
<p>From that effort was born <a href="http://raifbot.wordpress.com/">raifbot</a>, which hangs on out #uphpu on <a href="http://freenode.net/">freenode</a>.  It&#8217;s been fun hooking up bot commands to various features and servers, you can see the list of currently support commands at <a href="http://raifbot.wordpress.com/">http://raifbot.wordpress.com/</a>.  Many of the popular commands are just fun little diversions: <a href="http://raifbot.wordpress.com/commands-lart/">$lart</a>, <a href="http://raifbot.wordpress.com/commands-8ball/">$8ball</a>, <a href="http://raifbot.wordpress.com/commands-chuck-fact/">$chuck-fact</a>.  Others reach out to online services to provide info, like <a href="http://raifbot.wordpress.com/commands-weather/">$weather</a>.</p>
<p>Now back to the idea of using anonymous functions.  All of the command functions in raifbot have this style:</p>
<p>[sourcecode lang=&#8221;php&#8221;]<br />
$_commands[&#8216;rot13&#8217;] = function ( $channel, $nick, $msg ) {<br />
    global $bot;</p>
<p>    if ( empty( $msg ) ) {<br />
        return;<br />
    }</p>
<p>    $reply = &quot;{$nick} &#8211; rot13( &#8216;{$msg}&#8217; ) : &quot; . str_rot13( $msg );<br />
    $bot-&gt;send_message( $channel, $reply );<br />
};<br />
[/sourcecode]</p>
<p>Each command function definition is just an entry in the global <code>$_commands</code> array.</p>
<p>I used this approach because I had a particular feature in mind, the ability to add new commands and update existing ones without having to restart the bot process.  In the end I choose anonymous functions to accomplish this, which allowed me to avoid <code>eval</code> and other odd language hacks.</p>
<p>When I send a <code>HUP</code> signal to the bot process that triggers a reload of all the command files.  At that point updating a command function definition is just a matter of updating an entry in an array.  No errors and no fuss.  I add new commands and update existing ones without having to ever take down the bot process.  So far this has worked very well.</p>
<p>If you want to interact with raifbot join the #uphpu channel on freenode and give a spin.  Remember all of the commands start with $ and the list of supported commands is <a href="http://raifbot.wordpress.com/">http://raifbot.wordpress.com/</a>.</p>
<p>In addition to raifbot I&#8217;ve started a few other experimental projects.  Some more successful than others.  Though one I started last week I&#8217;m particularly excited about, I&#8217;ll post more on that after I&#8217;ve added a few more features.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This Thursday I&#8217;m going to talk about PHP and IRC bots at the <a href="http://uphpu.org/">UPHPU</a> meeting.  I recently wrote an IRC bot in PHP using the <a href="http://pear.php.net/package/Net_SmartIRC">Net_SmartIRC</a> library.  For now the bot, raifbot, has been living in #uphpu on freenode.  It understands some basic commands, like: $lart <nick>, $rlart, $chuck-fact, $random-number and so on.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll talk about the basics of getting started with Net_SmartIRC as well the details of how raifbot works.  Bring some ideas on new features you&#8217;d like to see in raifbot and we&#8217;ll add some of them live, during the meeting.</p>
<p>The UPHPU meeting is still at the Code Greene offices in down town Salt Lake City, but they&#8217;ve moved:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Please note the new location of Code Greene&#8217;s office, around the corner on State Street, between Charles Schwab on 300 S and America First/Five Star Restaurant/Gallivan Avenue. On street parking is usually plentiful, free after 6, and might be the best option, but there are garages there too
</p></blockquote>
<p>268 S State St #100<br />
Salt Lake City, UT  84111</p>
