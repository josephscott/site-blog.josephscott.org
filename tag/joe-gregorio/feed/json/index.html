An implementer wants to go from bits on the wire to a native data structure they can interact with in their programming language. I used to think that was laziness, or lack of knowledge, but it&#8217;s purely pragmatic. By using XML you have introduced a layer of indirection, you&#8217;ve taken a data structure and converted it into a tree based document which then has to be converted back into a native data structure, but now that has to be done on a per language basis.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>I&#8217;m in the lazy/pragmatic camp <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f642.png\" alt=\"\ud83d\ude42\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /></p>\n<p>I really don\u2019t want documents to describe data, I just want a nice way to serialize the data and right now my favored way of doing that is <a href=\"http://www.json.org/\">JSON</a>.</p>\n",
