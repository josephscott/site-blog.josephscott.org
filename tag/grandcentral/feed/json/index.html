This allows GC for ring all of your numbers to find you.  There are other features that you&#8217;d expect like voicemail, call recording, call blocking, etc.  All of these are managed via their website.

Why can&#8217;t I do this for my home phone (from PacBell/SBC/AT&amp;T/etc) or for my mobile phone (from Verizon)?  Really, I&#8217;d expect the kind of tracking and history that GC provides online from both AT&amp;T and Verizon.

Right now you can add a quick rule that will allow you to send all of your calls to voicemail or forward all calls to a temporary number.  Beyond that the only other schedule like option is the ability to not have your home phone number ring Monday through Friday 8 am to 6 pm.  That is and okay start, but I&#8217;d really like to put my daily schedule in there and customize the specific hours that each number should be used.</p>\n<p>I can&#8217;t help but think that this company is going to get purchased by someone big.
