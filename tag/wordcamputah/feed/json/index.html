            "content_text": "Recently I&#8217;ve been talking with a few people about the idea of a WordCamp ( WordPress conference ) in the Salt Lake City, Utah area.  This isn&#8217;t something that one person can do alone though, so I&#8217;m putting out the call for help and feed back.  If you are interested in helping make this happen we&#8217;ll be getting together for a planning meeting:\n\nApplebee's in Draper\n105 E 12300 S\nDraper, Utah 84020\n\nThursday 10 April 2008 @ 6:30pm\n\nUpcoming Event Page\n\nOne of the reasons we chose that Applebee&#8217;s location is because they have free WiFi, so feel free to bring your laptops.\nIn addition to people helping, I want to hear from Utah WordPress users about what they&#8217;d like to see in a WordCamp.  Any thoughts on potential locations (in the greater SLC area), sponsors, topics and speakers?  If you are interested in presenting let me know.
