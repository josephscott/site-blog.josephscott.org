										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Recently a friend in the neighborhood invited me over to look at the night sky through his new telescope.  Because of the time of night we opted to focus on just two things: the moon and Saturn.</p>
<p>It was cool to watch the moon &#8220;up close&#8221;.  Being able to see the surface in more detail was something I expected, what I didn&#8217;t expect is being able to see it move.  From time to time we had to adjust the telescope in order to bring it back into frame.</p>
<p>Seeing Saturn through the telescope also came with a surprise &#8211; we could see the rings around the planet!  What made them stand out is being able to see a little black gap between the rings and the planet.</p>
<p>The night sky is filled with wonder.</p>
