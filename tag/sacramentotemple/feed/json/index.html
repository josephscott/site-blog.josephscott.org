There will be an open house for the public starting 29 July through 26 August 2006.  So if you aren&#8217;t LDS and have an interest in see the temple contact one of your LDS friends and let them know.  It isn&#8217;t clear yet if you&#8217;ll need tickets or just show up for the open house.  Now that the date has been announced I expect the next few months will provide for greater details.</p>\n<p>If you are curious how the construction is going they still have the <a href=\"http://www.sacramentotemple.net/templecam/\">Sacramento Temple webcam</a> up.
