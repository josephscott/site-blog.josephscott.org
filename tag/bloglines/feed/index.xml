										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I started using <a href="http://bloglines.com/">Bloglines</a> in early 2004 to read feeds.  Despite the rise of <a href="http://www.google.com/reader">Google Reader</a> I stuck with Bloglines, which had that well broken in feeling after using it for so long.  I put up with the occasional outage and semi-regular bugs because most of the time it worked well enough.</p>
<p>This month I finally decided it was time to retire my Bloglines account and move over to Google Reader.  The comfort of sticking with a service that I&#8217;d known and loved for so long was finally over come by feeds that were way behind, bugs that made it impossible to use at times and outages that took the service completely offline.</p>
<p>That isn&#8217;t to say that Google Reader is perfect, there are some things that I&#8217;d like to have changed.  I will often quickly scan through new items via the &#8216;All Items&#8217; view (using the keyboard short cuts), but find it is really annoying that I can&#8217;t unsubscribe from a feed from there.  Instead I have to view just that feed and then I get the unsubscribe option.</p>
<p>Good bye Bloglines, you served me well, but the time has come for us to part ways.  Oh and by the way, I never did get my <a href="http://joseph.randomnetworks.com/archives/2005/03/14/i-love-bloglines-shirt-in-the-mail/">I Love Bloglines</a> shirt.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ug, just when I was preparing to write something positive about <a href="http://www.bloglines.com/">Bloglines</a>, they have messed up my sorting.

<p><strong>UPDATE 6:17pm 9 Jan 2006:</strong> The ability to resort seems to have been fixed/restored.</p>
