Some technologies don&#8217;t necessarily provide a built-in way to log conversations, but are easily augmented to do so.  One example of this is IRC.

But it&#8217;s more than just dumping the channel logs as HTML on a web page, each conversation can be linked to directly.  For example, here is the link to the start of last week&#8217;s dev meetup in #wordpress-dev : <a href=\"https://irclogs.wordpress.org/chanlog.php?channel=wordpress-dev&amp;day=2010-01-14#m55606\">https://irclogs.wordpress.org/chanlog.php?channel=wordpress-dev&amp;day=2010-01-14#m55606</a>.  From a collaboration point of view being able to link back like this is critical.

Where IRC is real-time group chat, email is asynchronous; it might be days before you get response back.  An archive of an email list can give the same sort of specific links that an IRC archive can.</p>\n<p>Other communication tools, like blogs and forums, by their very nature provide links.

It&#8217;s kind of a Twitter + forum blend.  On <a href=\"http://wordpress.com/\">WordPress.com</a> you can use it along with the <a href=\"http://im.wordpress.com/\">IM support for posts and comments</a>, that adds a realtime element to a blog.  At <a href=\"http://automattic.com/\">Automattic</a> we have numerous internal private blogs that are powered by P2, I use the IM feature to get instant notification when a new post or comment is added.
