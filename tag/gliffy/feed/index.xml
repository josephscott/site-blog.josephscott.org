										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://blog.guykawasaki.com/">Guy Kawasaki</a> brings out some interesting points about business.  <a href="http://blog.guykawasaki.com/2006/08/ten_things_to_l.html">Ten Things to Learn This School Year</a> picks on the general theme that what you learn in school is often completely opposite what is useful in business.  Some of these points are brought up in his <a href="http://blog.guykawasaki.com/2006/06/the_art_of_the_.html">Art of the Start</a> presentation.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been working on slides for a presentation at work and I&#8217;m trying to take Guy&#8217;s <a href="https://guykawasaki.com/the_102030_rule/">10/20/30 Rule of PowerPoint</a> to heart.  These are also covered in the Art of the Start talk as well.  I like the 30 point font rule.  As part of this I&#8217;ve been using <a href="http://gliffy.com/">Gliffy</a> for some of the diagrams in the presentation.  I&#8217;m not a heavy diagram user so I don&#8217;t have a detailed comparison of Gliffy versus Visio, but I will say that so far Gliffy has been a pleasure to use.</p>
