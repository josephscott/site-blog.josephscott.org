										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My <a href="/2021/01/01/utah-vaccination-math/">rough math for number of vaccines Utah needs to be giving each day</a> was 15,000.  Unfortunately <a href="https://coronavirus-dashboard.utah.gov/#vaccines">https://coronavirus-dashboard.utah.gov/#vaccines</a> only provides the total number of vaccines that have been given.  While that is helpful, it isn&#8217;t enough to determine if the pace is sufficient to get it to everyone who wants it by 1 September 2021.  For that we need daily numbers, and to track that trend over time ( they do this for covid-19 cases and deaths ).</p>
<p>I decided to solve that problem myself with a simple <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRLswt3xO8ckCQktr6RbAwWtGeu3ujqUK0LYLe97hE-vwxNFmtzWJSVDnVLwstYij7O5igCJmFDVMAt/pubhtml#">spreadsheet</a>.  I&#8217;m noting the total for each day and comparing it to the previous day to come up with the daily numbers. There are daily numbers for both the vaccinations given and the vaccine doses that have been received.</p>
<p><iframe height="500" src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRLswt3xO8ckCQktr6RbAwWtGeu3ujqUK0LYLe97hE-vwxNFmtzWJSVDnVLwstYij7O5igCJmFDVMAt/pubhtml?widget=true&amp;headers=false"></iframe></p>
<p>To make it easy to tell which days are over and under the 15,000 target I&#8217;ve applied condition formatting.  Pink for days with less than 15,000 and green for days with more than 15,000.  Nothing fancy, but it is effective at communicating the data in a glance.</p>
<p>Unfortunately I wasn&#8217;t able to find the total doses shipped for December 18th, 19th, 20th, 24th, 25th, and 31st; and January 1st and 3rd.  Those are noted by an asterisk next to them and on those days I used the previous known value.</p>
<p>The 2nd of January is the only day over 15,000 &#8211; at 16,174, but that covers multiple days due to the New Year&#8217;s Day holiday.  Today the daily number was 7,568 vaccinations, our highest single day number so far.  Unfortunately is only half of my estimated minimum of 15,000 per day that we&#8217;ll need to get it out to everyone by 1 September 2021.</p>
<p>Honestly, I&#8217;d rather they targeted a minimum of 25,000 vaccinations per day.  I realize that supply would need to keep up with that as well, which has other challenges.</p>
<p>A read-only version of the spreadsheet is publicly available at <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRLswt3xO8ckCQktr6RbAwWtGeu3ujqUK0LYLe97hE-vwxNFmtzWJSVDnVLwstYij7O5igCJmFDVMAt/pubhtml#">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRLswt3xO8ckCQktr6RbAwWtGeu3ujqUK0LYLe97hE-vwxNFmtzWJSVDnVLwstYij7O5igCJmFDVMAt/pubhtml#</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With 2020 behind us, at least chronologically, there is a strong push to get the covid-19 pandemic under control through vaccinations.  As has been <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/12/29/covid-19-vaccine-distribution-slow-testing/">widely reported</a>, the initial rate of vaccination has been slower that what was originally hoped for.  That got me wondering what the math looks like for vaccinations here in Utah.</p>
<p>The stated goal for a <a href="https://coronavirus-download.utah.gov/Health/Vaccine_Timeline.pdf" title="vaccination timeline in Utah">vaccination timeline in Utah</a> is having it available to &#8220;All Utahns&#8221; some where between March and July 2021.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/utah-vaccine-timeline.png"><img loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/utah-vaccine-timeline-791x1024.png" alt="" width="580" height="751" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-18338" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/utah-vaccine-timeline-791x1024.png 791w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/01/utah-vaccine-timeline-232x300.png 232w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/01/utah-vaccine-timeline-768x994.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/01/utah-vaccine-timeline-1187x1536.png 1187w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/01/utah-vaccine-timeline-1200x1553.png 1200w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/01/utah-vaccine-timeline.png 1275w" sizes="(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px" /></a></p>
<p>To make the math easier let&#8217;s say we want all Utahns who want the vaccine to be able to get it by 1 September 2021.  Here is one way to break that down.</p>
<p>&#8211; 243 days <a href="https://asd.gsfc.nasa.gov/Craig.Markwardt/doy2021.html">between</a> 1 January 2021 and 1 September 2021<br />
&#8211; 3,205,958 people in Utah ( <a href="https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/UT">estimate from 1 July 2019</a>, <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/www.census.gov_quickfacts_UT.png">screenshot</a> )<br />
&#8211; Of those, 29% are under the age of 18, leaving 2,276,230 adults</p>
<p>The Pfizer vaccine has been approved for 16 and up, while Moderna is 18 and up.  Continuing the simple approach, let&#8217;s go with 18 and up across the board, it also lines up with the population reference.</p>
<p>At the high end we would vaccinate 2,276,230 people in 243 days.  That would be 9,368 vaccinations a day if these were single shot systems, but they are not.  Each requires two shots, a few weeks apart.  Doubling that brings to 18,736 vaccinations a day.</p>
<p>We are unlikely to need 100% vaccination under control though.  The exact percentage needed isn&#8217;t known for sure, we can safely say that it would need to be a significant portion of the population.  I will go with 75% here:</p>
<pre>
2,276,230 people * 0.75 = 1,707,172 people
1,707,172 people * vaccine shots = 3,414,344 shots
3,414,344 shots / 243 days = 14,051 shots per day
</pre>
<p>To get to 75% of those 18 and over in Utah by 1 September 2021 we need to be giving more than 14,000 shots per day.</p>
<p>If 14,000 plus is the target, how are we doing so far?  On 30 December 2020 we hit <a href="https://twitter.com/RobertGehrke/status/1344737146070913024">6,230 vaccinations</a>.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/twitter-shots.png"><img loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/twitter-shots-927x1024.png" alt="" width="580" height="641" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-18347" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/twitter-shots-927x1024.png 927w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/01/twitter-shots-272x300.png 272w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/01/twitter-shots-768x848.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/01/twitter-shots-1200x1325.png 1200w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/01/twitter-shots.png 1306w" sizes="(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px" /></a></p>
<p>We will need to more than double that.</p>
<p>This doesn&#8217;t address the other 29% of the population that is under the age of 18 &#8211; another 929,728 people.  Hopefully at some point during 2021 there will be a vaccine that will be approved for children.  If that happens then we&#8217;ll need even more capacity beyond the 14,000 target.  That could easily put us in the 15,000 to 16,000 shots per day range.</p>
<p>Given all of the variables, my rough math points me towards a <strong>minimum</strong> target of 15,000 vaccinations per day, every day.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The current situation has reminded of a story I heard long ago, comparing heaven and hell.  The version I remember went something like this:</p>
<blockquote><p>
A man was praying to God desiring to know what heaven and hell were like.  God then showed the man two doors.  Upon entering the first door he saw a large round table, with an enormous bowl of soup in the middle.  The smell of the soup was so enticing he immediately wanted to taste it.  Seated all around the table were people who clearly had not been eating, they were too thin, and looked ill.</p>
<p>Strapped to one hand of each person was a very long spoon, longer than the length of any of their arms.  Because of the length of the spoon they were able to easily scoop up soup from the bowl, but the spoon was so long they couldn&#8217;t reach their own mouth.  The situation resulted in each person around the table starving, even while having ready access to food.</p>
<p>God turned to the man and explained that this was hell.</p>
<p>They then entered the second door and the setup was the same as the first.  A large table, the bowl of enticing soup, and people around the table with long spoons strapped to their hands.  But the condition of the people around the table was completely different.  These people were clearly well fed, laughing with one another, and happy.</p>
<p>Upon seeing the similar conditions, but dramatically different results, the man turned to God and asked him why this room was different.</p>
<p>With a smile on his face God explained that the people in the second room quickly realized that while their spoons were too long to serve themselves, they were just the right size for serving others at the table.  By serving each other everyone at the table was able to eat as much as they wanted.  In contrast the hungry people in the first room couldn&#8217;t set aside their selfishness and greed long enough to learn how to serve others.
</p></blockquote>
<p>The point was to illustrate that sharing with and serving others gets you further than only thinking about yourself.  It was only recently that I learned this was called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegory_of_the_long_spoons">the allegory of the long spoons</a>.</p>
<p>Why am I sharing this now?  I see this story as descriptive of <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/downloads/cloth-face-coverings-information.pdf">being asked to wear face masks</a> ( emphasis mine ):</p>
<blockquote><p>
Cloth face coverings prevent the person wearing the mask from spreading respiratory droplets when talking, sneezing, or coughing. <strong>If everyone wears a cloth face covering when out in public</strong>, such as going to the grocery store, <strong>the risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 can be reduced for the community</strong>. Since people can spread the virus before symptoms start, or even if people never have symptoms, wearing a cloth face covering can protect others around you. Face coverings worn by others protect you from getting the virus from people carrying the virus.</p>
<p><cite>&#8211; The CDC</cite>
</p></blockquote>
<p>One way for you to be protected when you need to go out is having everyone else around you wearing a mask.  You in turn can help protect others by wearing a mask as well.  By everyone participating, everyone benefits.</p>
<p>A modern 2020 variant of the allegory of the long spoons might be <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/diy-cloth-face-coverings.html">the allegory of the face masks</a>.</p>
