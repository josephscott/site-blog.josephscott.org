Unfortunately there was no link to reference where that number came from, so I went looking for supporting data.  I found it on the <a href=\"http://www.usmint.gov/about_the_mint/?action=annual_report\">United States Mint Annual Report</a> page.  Specifically the <a href=\"http://www.usmint.gov/downloads/about/annual_report/2011AnnualReport.pdf\">2011 Annual Report</a> (PDF), page 11.  It breaks down the cost of a 1 cent piece (penny) as:</p>\n<table>\n<tr>\n<td>Cost of Goods Sold</td>\n<td>$ 0.0197</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Sales, General &#038; Administrative</td>\n<td>$ 0.0041</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Distribution to FRB</td>\n<td>$ 0.0003</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Total Unit Cost</strong></td>\n<td><strong>$ 0.0241</strong></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<p>Making the total cost for a $0.01 piece $0.0241.  Not hard to see how the math works against us there.  But the Fortune article also made this claim, that I hadn&#8217;t heard before:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\nIt also costs more than a nickel to make a nickel, but there&#8217;s no movement to discontinue that coin.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>So back to page 11 of the 2011 Annual Report for the total cost to produce a nickel:</p>\n<table>\n<tr>\n<td>Cost of Goods Sold</td>\n<td>$ 0.0938</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Sales, General &#038; Administrative</td>\n<td>$ 0.0176</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Distribution to FRB</td>\n<td>$ 0.0004</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Total Unit Cost </strong></td>\n<td><strong>$ 0.1118</strong></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<p>The cost overrun of a five cent piece is in the same ball park as the one cent piece, with a cost that is 2.236 times the value of the coin.  If your reason for wanting to ditch the penny is the crazy cost to value difference then the nickel needs to go as well.</p>\n<p>Thankfully the total cost to make a dime ( $ 0.0565 ), quarter ( $ 0.1114 ), and one dollar coin ( $ 0.1803 ) are well below their stated value.  But how long would that be true?  This got me wondering how long the penny and nickel have been upside down in value.  I started going through earlier U.S. Mint Annual Reports to see what could be learned from the cost trends.  Lucky for us their site provides data on the costs going back to 2000.</p>\n<p>To simplify the issue some what I choose to focus only on the cost of goods sold (COGS) for each coin.  I did this for a couple of reasons.  First, I felt like it was better to focus on the specific issue of the production costs, instead including administrative and distribution costs.  Second, for some years there is no data for administrative costs, making a direct comparison on the total cost unreliable.</p>\n<p>Here is the COGS history for the penny:</p>\n<table>\n<tr>\n<th>Year</th>\n<th>One Cent (Penny) COGS</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2000</td>\n<td>0.0081</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2001</td>\n<td>0.0079</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2002</td>\n<td>0.0085</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2003</td>\n<td>0.0093</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2004</td>\n<td>0.0090</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2005</td>\n<td>0.0095</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2006</td>\n<td>0.0119</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2007</td>\n<td>0.0165</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2008</td>\n<td>0.0139</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2009</td>\n<td>0.0159</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2010</td>\n<td>0.0176</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2011</td>\n<td>0.0197</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<p>The same data in graph form:</p>\n<figure style=\"width: 576px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Penny Cost of Goods Sold\" src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-6K44nTzG5Ls/T4uiEwAJrgI/AAAAAAAAAYU/J7-_xLoN_Rk/s576/penny-cogs.png\" title=\"Penny\" width=\"576\" height=\"364\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Penny Cost of Goods Sold</figcaption></figure>\n<p>It was 2006 when the COGS for a penny went above one cent, to $0.0119.</p>\n<p>Now for the nickel:</p>\n<table>\n<tr>\n<th>Year</th>\n<th>Five Cent (Nickel) COGS</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2000</td>\n<td>0.0313</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2001</td>\n<td>0.0329</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2002</td>\n<td>0.0306</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2003</td>\n<td>0.0346</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2004</td>\n<td>0.0446</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2005</td>\n<td>0.0478</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2006</td>\n<td>0.0592</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2007</td>\n<td>0.0949</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2008</td>\n<td>0.0877</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2009</td>\n<td>0.0579</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2010</td>\n<td>0.0916</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2011</td>\n<td>0.0938</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<p>And the graph:</p>\n<figure style=\"width: 578px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Nickel Cost of Goods Sold\" src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-uPmv11UP804/T4uopJNvYRI/AAAAAAAAAYk/FPKUucP0kLw/s578/nickel-cogs.png\" title=\"Nickel Cost of Goods Sold\" width=\"578\" height=\"368\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Nickel Cost of Goods Sold</figcaption></figure>\n<p>I double checked that I had the 2009 number correct because it was such a large dip.
