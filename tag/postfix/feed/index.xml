										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve been running <a href="http://www.sendmail.org/">Sendmail</a> on systems since 1996, so it was a pretty big deal for me to finally move over to <a href="http://www.postfix.org/">Postfix</a> as my MTA of choice.  Once I finally made the switch though I was much happier.  Overall I found that getting Postfix to do what I wanted was easier than doing the same thing with Sendmail.</p>
<p>Today I noticed the development of completely new version of Sendmail: <a href="http://www.sendmail.org/sm-X/index.html">Sendmail X</a>.  On the surface it looks like they are taking many of the same principles used Postfix for this rewrite.  Instead of one big process that does everything, they&#8217;ve broken it out into <a href="http://www.sendmail.org/%7Eca/email/sm-X/design-2005-05-05/main/node3.html#SECTION00311000000000000000">modules</a>, some of which will be threaded.  There&#8217;s a new <a href="http://www.sendmail.org/%7Eca/email/sm-X/design-2005-05-05/main/node3.html#SECTION00322000000000000000">configuration syntax</a> that reminds me of the <a href="http://www.isc.org/index.pl?/sw/bind/">Bind 8/9</a> syntax.  Some <a href="http://www.sendmail.org/%7Eca/email/sm-X/design-2005-05-05/main/node2.html#SECTION00220000000000000000">features are being left out</a> (at least initially), like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UUCP">UUCP</a>, 7 bit <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIME">MIME</a> conversion and support for dialup systems.</p>
<p>Does anyone still use UUCP?  Fortunately I was spared ever having to go through that.  I don&#8217;t recall where I heard this, but the joke about how to get UUCP working was to find someone else that already had it working and duplicate what they had.  I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve ever heard anyone say anything good about UUCP.</p>
<p>There is a huge &#8220;<a href="http://www.sendmail.org/%7Eca/email/sm-X/design-2005-05-05/main/main.html">Requirements, Architecture, Functional Specification, Implementation, and Performance</a>&#8221; document that is chalk full of specification details for Sendmail X if you want to know more.  For now I&#8217;m going to stay with Postfix.</p>
