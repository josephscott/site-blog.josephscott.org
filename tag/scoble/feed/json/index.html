Recently he&#8217;s been on a kick talking about <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_of_mouth\">buzz</a> around the web, citing things like the announcement of <a href=\"http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2005/07/moon-children.html\">Google Moon</a> recently.  He also compared <a href=\"http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2005/07/22.html#a10728\">Microsoft and Apple</a> in blog buzz and a few wider market counts.  His reference to Howard Dean seems on when it comes to blog buzz, it doesn&#8217;t necessarily correlate to popularity in the general population.  Despite that Scoble still seems to have a touch jealousy about not getting more blog love buzz for Microsoft.</p>\n<p>So today he tried to go on the <a href=\"http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2005/07/23.html#a10733\">offensive by responding to a MacDailyNews post</a>.  Scoble managed to not learn his own lesson here, and most folks will likely call him on it.  First off the <a href=\"http://macdailynews.com/index.php/weblog/comments/6356/\">MacDailyNews article</a> is nothing but name calling (think 2nd grade here), even those who use Apple products (of which I am one) recognize this and quickly move on or completely ignore in the first place.  He would have been much better if he&#8217;d just left this alone or focused purely on features, not trying to return fire.</p>\n<p>But since he did lets take a look at his response:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Tablet PC: I haven&#8217;t seen anyone use a tablet system, and I see a fair number of notebook systems in use by people through out the year.  Perhaps it is because I work at a university and that market isn&#8217;t interested in tablet systems.  Perhaps I&#8217;m missing the boat here, but I don&#8217;t see this as being a big deal.  Having said that though, he is correct on this point, Apple does not offer a tablet system.  Neither does Microsoft, they only sell the OS.  If I install FreeBSD or Linux on said tablet system then Microsoft is out of the picture.  I also couldn&#8217;t find anywhere on Microsoft&#8217;s website where I could actually purchase a tablet system.</li>\n<li>Media Center: Again, I couldn&#8217;t find anywhere on Microsoft&#8217;s website to purchase such a thing.  They sell an OS for such a thing, but then again I could also use <a href=\"http://www.mythtv.org/\">MythTV</a> and get the same thing.  He is right on some level though, Apple doesn&#8217;t sell a system with Tivo features.  Neither does Microsoft.</li>\n<li>Mobile Phone: Still couldn&#8217;t find any place on Microsoft&#8217;s website where I can buy said Windows phone.  They make software for mobile devices, but so do other vendors.</li>\n<li>Mac on Intel: And I can&#8217;t get Windows for my PowerPC system.  There is a developer system from Apple running on Intel hardware, but that doesn&#8217;t really meet the term shipping in this sense.  So he does have a small point here, but again if I install FreeBSD/Linux on my Intel box Microsoft is out of the picture.  And just like before, I couldn&#8217;t find such hardware offered for sale from Microsoft either.</li>\n<li>Integration with XBox: It isn&#8217;t clear exactly what he means by this, but if it is simply the ability to have your computer talk to your XBox then he is right Apple doesn&#8217;t sell such a thing.  I don&#8217;t see what this has to do with releasing a new operating system.</li>\n<li>MSN Watches: I have to admit that I&#8217;ve never even heard of such a thing.
