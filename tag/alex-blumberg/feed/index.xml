										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Alex Blumberg has a new podcast &#8211; <a href="http://hearstartup.com/">StartUp</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
I&#8217;m Alex Blumberg. My experience is in public radio, as a producer for This American Life and as a co-founder of the business-economics series Planet Money. After years of reporting on other people&#8217;s businesses, I decided to start my own.</p>
<p>This show follows what happens next – my difficult journey from man to businessman. It&#8217;s a classic start-up story, but one that&#8217;s recorded in real time. I&#8217;ve documented disastrous pitches to investors, difficult conversations with my wife, and tense negotiations with my co-founder. The result is an honest, transparent account of something that happens all the time, but that we can rarely listen in on: starting a business.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I found all four of the episodes posted so far really enjoyable.  Part of that comes from having listened to Alex Blumberg before and the good production quality.  </p>
<p>The other part is the feeling that you are along for the ride, sitting in the back seat of a car while two people are talking about this experience.</p>
