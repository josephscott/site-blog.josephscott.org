										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I wasn&#8217;t really surprised when I read <a href="http://www.kottke.org/05/08/so-long-technorati">Kottke&#8217;s farewell to Technorati</a> last week.  I&#8217;ve been on the edge of giving up too, but I&#8217;m still hoping that they&#8217;ll be able to turn things around.  I get errors of one kind or another when trying to use <a href="http://www.technorati.com/">Technorati</a> more than 50% of the time I try to use their site.  Unfortunately it has only been getting worse.</p>
<p>So when I read todays <a href="http://www.technorati.com/weblog/2005/08/43.html">announcement about Technorati and Newsweek</a> I was upset at first.  It is great and all for <a href="http://www.newsweek.com/">Newsweek</a> to be bringing in <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/7681901/site/newsweek/">blog commentary on the articles</a>, this is a big step for them.  But I was ticked that Technorati, who can&#8217;t even get their site to work half of the time, is expanding their services to others instead of making the darn thing work in the first place.</p>
<p>Then it hit me, perhaps Technorati is getting a boat load of money to provide this service to Newsweek.  I mean a lot of money, in multiple shipping containers.  Hopefully this is the case, because they need some way to make their site work and I&#8217;m hoping that a metric ton of money will make that possible.  Otherwise they are going to sink futher down the drain and users will move to services that don&#8217;t return a page bragging about their site being broken because they are recieving too much traffic.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE 1:05pm 25 Aug 2005:</strong> One of the reasons I&#8217;ve continued to hold on to hope with Technorati is because <a href="http://www.sifry.com/alerts/">Dave Sifry</a> still takes the time to respond to posts like this (see the first comment).  I&#8217;m hoping that someone with that much passion for their business will find some way to make things better.</p>
