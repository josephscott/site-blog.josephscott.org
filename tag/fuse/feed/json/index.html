            "content_html": "<p>Here is something else I&#8217;ve been toying with: <a href=\"https://github.com/josephscott/pressfs\">pressfs</a>, a WordPress filesystem.  Currently it exposes user, post, tag, and category data in a read-only filesystem.</p>\n<h3>The Short Version</h3>\n<p>This is a <a href=\"http://www.python.org/\">Python</a> script that uses <a href=\"http://fuse.sourceforge.net/\">FUSE</a> to expose data from a <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/\">WordPress</a> site as a filesystem.</p>\n<p>For the impatient you can give this a try in just a few steps:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>get the <a href=\"https://github.com/josephscott/pressfs\">pressfs source code</a> from Github</li>\n<li>install and activate the pressfs WordPress plugin</li>\n<li>copy example-config.ini config.ini</li>\n<li>edit config.ini, set values in WordPress section</li>\n<li>python pressfs.py /your/mount/point/</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This code is still roughly beta quality, try it out on a test/dev WordPress install first.  Authentication is just HTTP basic, so please use it over SSL.  It also needs to use an administrator level WordPress account (something that might change in the future).</p>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>A little over two years ago I started thinking about writing a WordPress plugin to act as a WebDAV server so that we could expose media uploads as an easily mounted filesystem.  I poked around a bit, but quickly put the idea on the shelf and worked on other things.  Fast forward to early 2011, after I got <a href=\"http://josephscott.org/archives/2011/05/an-irc-experiment-raifbot/\">raifbot</a> into a functional state I started taking a more serious look at WordPress + WebDAV.  As a concept this is definitely plausible, but after trying several different approaches I decided I wasn&#8217;t interested in dealing with the edge cases I ran into (<a href=\"http://nginx.org/\">nginx</a> not having built in support for <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chunked_transfer_encoding\">chunked encoding</a> was particularly irksome).</p>\n<p>Although I wasn&#8217;t happy with the WebDAV issues, I still kept thinking about ways we could expose WordPress resources as a filesystem.  A few weeks later I started experimenting with the idea of using FUSE to expose WordPress data as a filesystem.  It was a rough start, but I finally got it to a point where it was time to share with others and get more feedback.</p>\n<h3>Python</h3>\n<p>I don&#8217;t have much experience writing Python code, which isn&#8217;t surprising since my full time job has involved WordPress and WordPress related development (lots of PHP code).  Sure, I&#8217;ve tweaked a few Python scripts from time to time, read <a href=\"http://diveintopython.org/\">Dive Into Python</a> and toyed with some of the examples, but I&#8217;ve never sat down to write new code for a new project in Python until now.

            "content_text": "Here is something else I&#8217;ve been toying with: pressfs, a WordPress filesystem.  Currently it exposes user, post, tag, and category data in a read-only filesystem.\nThe Short Version\nThis is a Python script that uses FUSE to expose data from a WordPress site as a filesystem.\nFor the impatient you can give this a try in just a few steps:\n\nget the pressfs source code from Github\ninstall and activate the pressfs WordPress plugin\ncopy example-config.ini config.ini\nedit config.ini, set values in WordPress section\npython pressfs.py /your/mount/point/\n\nThis code is still roughly beta quality, try it out on a test/dev WordPress install first.  Authentication is just HTTP basic, so please use it over SSL.  It also needs to use an administrator level WordPress account (something that might change in the future).\nHistory\nA little over two years ago I started thinking about writing a WordPress plugin to act as a WebDAV server so that we could expose media uploads as an easily mounted filesystem.  I poked around a bit, but quickly put the idea on the shelf and worked on other things.  Fast forward to early 2011, after I got raifbot into a functional state I started taking a more serious look at WordPress + WebDAV.  As a concept this is definitely plausible, but after trying several different approaches I decided I wasn&#8217;t interested in dealing with the edge cases I ran into (nginx not having built in support for chunked encoding was particularly irksome).\nAlthough I wasn&#8217;t happy with the WebDAV issues, I still kept thinking about ways we could expose WordPress resources as a filesystem.  A few weeks later I started experimenting with the idea of using FUSE to expose WordPress data as a filesystem.  It was a rough start, but I finally got it to a point where it was time to share with others and get more feedback.\nPython\nI don&#8217;t have much experience writing Python code, which isn&#8217;t surprising since my full time job has involved WordPress and WordPress related development (lots of PHP code).
