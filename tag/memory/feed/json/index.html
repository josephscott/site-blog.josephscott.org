If someone mentions something at work at the end of the day sometimes I&#8217;ll leave a post it note on my monitor so that I&#8217;ll see it in the morning.  Sarah does something similar at home, she&#8217;ll leave herself a note on the bathroom mirror before going to bed so she&#8217;ll see it in the morning.</p>\n<p>A year or two ago I saw a friend of mine leave a reminder for himself by calling his work number and leaving a voicemail.  I thought it was rather odd at the time, but since then I&#8217;ve done it a few times myself.  What I find is that when I call work number (usually from my cell phone) and leave voicemail explaining what I&#8217;m supposed to remember, the mere act of leaving the voicemail tends to keep that info/task in my thoughts.  As a result I usually end taking care of what ever it was that I needed to do before I even check my voicemail in the morning.  So this idea of leaving reminders via voicemail seems to work, at least so far.</p>\n<p>The next step from there is some sort of timed message reminder.  I&#8217;ve done this before with alphanumeric pagers using <a href=\"http://www.qpage.org/\">QuickPage</a> (qpage), which allows to schedule your alphanumeric page to be sent at a given date and time in the future.  Many calendar systems do the same thing with email, reminding you of upcoming events.  What I&#8217;d like to have schedule voice reminders.</p>\n<p>I want to be able to call a number, leave a message and schedule when I want that message to call me (i.e. 4 Aug 2005 @ 4:15pm).  I should also be able to tell it which phone number to call (cell, work, home, friend?) and optionally to try them all in a given order if no one answers, or if the voicemail or answering machine picks up instead of a person.  On top of all that I should be able to optionally sync calendar items via some sort of text to voice via the same service.  Perhaps with some email integration also?</p>\n<p>I wonder if the mobile phone providers will jump on this idea.  Heck, no reason the land line providers shouldn&#8217;t be able to jump on this.
