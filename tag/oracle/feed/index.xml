										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Everything that I&#8217;ve read so far about the Oregon state health exchange web site has been bad news.  Oregonlive.com has a lengthy article <a href="http://www.oregonlive.com/health/index.ssf/2013/12/oregon_health_exchange_technol.html" title="Mismanagement is something of an understatement.">spelling out the mismanagement details</a>.  </p>
<p>Don&#8217;t worry though, the state of Oregon has done a good job taking care of Oracle:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Nevertheless, Oregon has been good for Oracle. Between the OHA and Cover Oregon, the state has paid Oracle more than $90 million over the last two years and could pay the company another $30 million or more. Overall, the project has cost more than $160 million so far.
</p></blockquote>
<p>For the $90 million that Oracle has received over the last two years it has provided an unusable web site.</p>
<p>What to do now that the deadlines have hit and there is no way to provide online enrollment?  Go back to the old methods of course:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Cover Oregon leaders, meanwhile, have swung their attention away from the website to processing paper applications by hand, hiring more than 400 reinforcements.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Oracle is a huge company, in their last fiscal year ( ending 31 May 2013 ) it had a net income of $10.9 billion on $37.1 billion in revenue.  Making the $90 million that Oregon has paid them a small drop in their very large bucket.  That doesn&#8217;t excuse their failure to deliver though.</p>
<p>At this point Oracle should stop making this about money and Larry Ellison should step up and make it about pride and honor.  Do what ever it takes to make things right for the state of Oregon, and do it without taking another dime.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Amazon recently announced support for <a href="http://aws.typepad.com/aws/2010/05/amazon-rds-multi-az-deployment.html">multi-zone MySQL instances with automatic failover</a>.  The general idea is that Amazon will make the on demand MySQL service they offer more fault tolerant, which is a wonderful thing to have.  It&#8217;s not there yet, but being able to send reads to another replicated server MySQL instance is on the future feature list.  When <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/rds/">Amazon Relation Database Service (RDS)</a> was announced it was clear that Amazon was going to continue building out core infrastructure services, so these additional high availability options are nice to see, but not a huge surprise.</p>
<p>As happy as I am to see Amazon doing this, my general feeling is one of disappointment that <a href="http://sun.com/">Sun</a> didn&#8217;t do more in this area when they purchased <a href="http://mysql.com/">MySQL</a>.  Not long after the Sun/MySQL deal I wrote <a href="http://joseph.randomnetworks.com/archives/2008/04/28/sun-should-be-in-the-consumer-cloud-services-business/">Sun Should Be in the Consumer Cloud Services Business</a>.  My thought was that Sun should offer an EC2/S3 style pay as you go service for MySQL.  And it should be open to anyone with a credit card, making this basically a consumer play, but could be used by big companies as well.</p>
<p>Now Sun and MySQL are in the hands of <a href="http://www.oracle.com/">Oracle</a>.  The opportunity for Oracle to offer a similar service is still there, but I see it as being even less likely now than when it was just Sun+MySQL.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s surprising to me to see capable companies you might normally think of as being in the best position to offer these types of services continue to let Amazon run further and further ahead of the pack.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Four days after <a href="http://joseph.randomnetworks.com/archives/2006/02/10/oracle-buying-open-source-companies/">commenting on Oracle&#8217;s purchasing rumors</a> of three companies, one of them has been confirmed.  <a href="http://news.com.com/2100-7344_3-6039070.html?part=rss&amp;tag=6039070&amp;subj=news">Sleepycat was purchased by Oracle</a> today.  The <a href="http://www.oracle.com/corporate/press/2006_feb/sleepycat.html">official announcement</a> has virtually no details other than to confirm the transaction.</p>
<p>One can&#8217;t help but think that <a href="http://www.oracle.com/">Oracle</a> is giving <a href="http://www.mysql.com/">MySQL</a> every reason to just give up and be purchased by Oracle.  As an outsider it sure looks like MySQL is the main target to either be bought or crushed by Oracle.  One of the comments on <a href="http://jeremy.zawodny.com/blog/archives/006297.html">Jeremy&#8217;s post about the Sleepycat purchase</a> even suggests that MySQL was able to <a href="http://www.mysql.com/news-and-events/press-release/release_2006_10.html">secure an additional $18.5 million in funding</a> because of the potential return when/if Oracle buys MySQL.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll have to wait and see if the rumors about JBoss and Zend turn out to true.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.businessweek.com/index.html">BusinessWeek</a> is reporting that <a href="http://www.oracle.com/">Oracle</a> is <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/feb2006/tc20060209_810527.htm">looking to buy more open source companies</a>.  Specifically they mention <a href="http://jboss.com/">JBoss</a>, <a href="http://www.zend.com/">Zend</a> and <a href="http://www.sleepycat.com/">Sleepycat</a>.  Nothing official has been announced yet, but keep in mind that it was only a few months ago when <a href="http://joseph.randomnetworks.com/archives/2005/10/08/oracle-buys-innobase/">Oracle bought the company behind InnoDB (Innobase)</a>.</p>
<p>All of these moves prompt one question, will Oracle start to play hard ball with these companies other database clients?  Zend for instance has been pushing for more <a href="http://www-306.ibm.com/software/data/db2/">DB2</a> (<a href="http://www.ibm.com/">IBM</a>&#8216;s database server), if Oracle were to own Zend would this trend stop?  Would Oracle direct these three companies to focus resources on making their products work best with the Oracle database and let the community worry about supporting everyone else?</p>
<p>Although not as popular as InnoDB, the Berkeley DB from Sleepycat is also a supported storage back end for <a href="http://www.mysql.com/">MySQL</a>.  On top of that, <a href="http://www.php.net/">PHP</a> (which is what Zend works on) is probably the most commonly used language to access MySQL databases.  If I were the MySQL folks I&#8217;d really have to wonder if Oracle is trying to knock you out by buying up everything around you.</p>
<p>Makes me glad that there is no one specific company behind the <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/">Apache web server</a>, other wise that would be a likely purchase target as well.  Perhaps the closest thing to an Apache company would be <a href="http://www.covalent.net/">Covalent</a>.  Going down the stack leads us to <a href="http://www.redhat.com/">Red Hat</a> as the next likely target.  Not only would this get them an operating system (OS) of their own, they would get all of the other companies and technologies that Red Hat has acquired over the years.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know if either of these companies (Covalent and Red Hat) would be willing to sell to Oracle, but if Oracle could pull that off they&#8217;d have everything (assuming they also pick up JBoss, Zend and Sleepycat) to offer a real physical database server.  I&#8217;m imagining something along the lines of the <a href="http://www.google.com/enterprise/gsa/">Google Search Appliance</a> (GSA).  Perhaps 2007 will be the year of the Oracle Database Appliance (ODA)?</p>
<p>An ODA would of course have Oracle database software running on it, but on top of that would have a web based admin served via the Apache web server and written in PHP or Java.  All sorts of PHP and Java hooks would already be in place and available on the ODA.  And in true Oracle form it would cost an arm and a leg, based on the number of CPUs and RAM you wanted to have in the system <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />  Entry level ODA for say $25,000 per year?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Jeremy talks about <a href="http://jeremy.zawodny.com/blog/archives/005490.html">Oracle buying Innobase</a>, the folks behind InnoDB for <a href="http://www.mysql.com/">MySQL</a>.

Even if Oracle doesn&#8217;t do anything (one way or the other), this will certainly make people wonder about the future of InnoDB.</p>
<p>What attraction does Innobase have for Oracle?  I doubt that it is their technology, even with everything that InnoDB has brought to MySQL, Oracle&#8217;s database does much more.  I can&#8217;t image that share holders would like the idea of Oracle funding a competitor out of kindness.  It is possible that they are mostly interested in the people/talent at Innobase, but if those folks start working on Oracle projects where does that leave InnoDB development?</p>
