I&#8217;m not sure if we&#8217;ll see 5.3 or 5.2.9 as the next PHP release, so I tested snapshots from both branches with libxml2 2.7.3 and confirmed that they both work.\nAfter this all started there were a few patches making the rounds that basically changed the encoding for the HTML entities that were having problems.  I&#8217;ve done some light testing of those for the XML-RPC case and found that they do appear to work.  I&#8217;m not sure yet about adding that to WordPress, especially now that we&#8217;ve got viable fixes at the PHP and libxml2 level.  I think if we see a PHP release soon that includes this fix then it&#8217;s best to encourage people to upgrade to address the problem.",
