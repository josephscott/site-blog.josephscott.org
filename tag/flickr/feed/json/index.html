It used <code>.jpg</code> as the extension for all of the files, even the videos.  I didn&#8217;t realized this until the export was done.  So I whipped up a simple Bash script to change the extension on the video files to <code>.mov</code>:</p>\n<p>[sourcecode lang=&#8221;bash&#8221;]<br />\n#!/bin/bash</p>\n<p>cd $1</p>\n<p>for file in *<br />\ndo<br />\n    filename=$(basename $file)<br />\n    filename=&quot;${filename%.*}&quot;<br />\n    mimetype=$(file &#8211;mime-type -b &quot;$file&quot;)<br />\n    case $mimetype in<br />\n        video/quicktime)<br />\n            mv -v &quot;$filename.jpg&quot; &quot;$filename.mov&quot;<br />\n            ;;<br />\n    esac<br />\ndone<br />\n[/sourcecode]</p>\n<p>In the end I had nearly 7,000 files from my Flickr account.</p>\n<h3>Importing To Google Photos</h3>\n<p>I started with using the web based uploader, since it worked fine for the one off items in the past.
