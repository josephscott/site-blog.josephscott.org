										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Jeremy talks about <a href="http://jeremy.zawodny.com/blog/archives/005490.html">Oracle buying Innobase</a>, the folks behind InnoDB for <a href="http://www.mysql.com/">MySQL</a>.  I don&#8217;t really have too much to add, I suspect most people are at least a little bit nervous at what <a href="http://www.oracle.com/">Oracle</a> might do to InnoDB development.  Even if Oracle doesn&#8217;t do anything (one way or the other), this will certainly make people wonder about the future of InnoDB.</p>
<p>What attraction does Innobase have for Oracle?  I doubt that it is their technology, even with everything that InnoDB has brought to MySQL, Oracle&#8217;s database does much more.  I can&#8217;t image that share holders would like the idea of Oracle funding a competitor out of kindness.  It is possible that they are mostly interested in the people/talent at Innobase, but if those folks start working on Oracle projects where does that leave InnoDB development?</p>
