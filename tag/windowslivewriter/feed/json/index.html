This also addressed my question of how it should be done (via mt_keywords).</p>\n<p>Then we started getting really close to the final release of 2.3 and I realized that I hadn&#8217;t looked at how Windows Live Writer dealt with the mt_keywords field.  The good news was that it already had keyword support, the bad news was that it only supported it if it knew that the blog on the could deal with it correctly.

Unfortunately by the time that all of this was done it was too late to get it into release of 2.3.  So if you were bummed that WLW didn&#8217;t support the new tag features in 2.3 out of the box that was completely my bad.  If I&#8217;d realized what had needed to be done sooner then it probably would have made it.
