										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The official description for <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/">Amazon Aurora</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Amazon Aurora is a MySQL-compatible, relational database engine that combines the speed and availability of high-end commercial databases with the simplicity and cost-effectiveness of open source databases.
</p></blockquote>
<p>This video provides more details:</p>
<a href="/2015/12/30/amazon-rds-for-aurora/"><img src="/wp-content/plugins/wp-youtube-lyte/lyteCache.php?origThumbUrl=%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FCwWFrZGMDds%2Fhqdefault.jpg" alt="YouTube Video"></a><br /><br /></p>
<p>Looking at all this I&#8217;m reminded of something I wrote back in April 2008: <a href="https://josephscott.org/archives/2008/04/sun-should-be-in-the-consumer-cloud-services-business/">Sun Should Be in the Consumer Cloud Services Business</a> ( this was a few months after Sun purchased MySQL and before Oracle purchased Sun ):</p>
<blockquote><p>
What I’d like to see from Sun is a MySQL cloud service that works just like your current MySQL server(s), only better. It should scale such that I don’t have to worry about performance and replicate data sufficiently that I’ll always have access to my data. There’s no need for a new API, since MySQL already supports network connectivity.
</p></blockquote>
<p>It feels like Amazon was aiming for the same thing with Aurora.  The rest, as they say, is history.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When I look at the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/">AWS Global Infrastructure</a> map I&#8217;m surprised at the lack of entries for Canada.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/aws-global-locations-1.png"><img loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/aws-global-locations-1-1024x580.png" alt="aws-global-locations" width="660" height="374" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-14572" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/aws-global-locations-1-1024x580.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/12/aws-global-locations-1-300x170.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/12/aws-global-locations-1-768x435.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/12/aws-global-locations-1-1200x680.png 1200w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/12/aws-global-locations-1.png 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px" /></a></p>
<p>First priority for global infrastructure is clearly to be in spots around the globe.  To some degree that has been accomplished, with more locations planned for the future.</p>
<p>One of those &#8216;coming soon&#8217; locations in Ohio.  I have nothing against Ohio, I just thought it was an odd decision compared to some place in Canada.</p>
<p>You might be wondering why I suggested Canada.  While Canada is only the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_and_dependencies_by_population">37th largest country by population</a>, it is a different story when it comes to trade with the United States.</p>
<p>What country is ranked number one in <a href="https://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/statistics/highlights/top/top1412yr.html">total trade with the United States</a>?  You might think it was China, and they are very high on the list ( #2 ).  Turns out Canada is #1, ahead of China by 11.4%.</p>
<p>For that reason alone I would have guessed that AWS would open up a location in Canada before Ohio.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dropbox <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/developers/blog/90/announcing-dropbox-webhooks">launched support for webhooks</a>.  This is a great move.</p>
<p>Amazon S3 does have something similar.  You can enable <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/NotificationHowTo.html">notifications via their Simple Notification Service ( SNS )</a>, but then you are charged for the SNS usage.  For many people that will make it less appealing than traditional direct webhooks.</p>
<p>Dropbox continues to use a mix of Amazon Web Services ( AWS ) and separate dedicated hardware to manage user file.  I wonder if they are using any AWS services to process what are likely millions of HTTP requests for webhooks.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A couple of days after suggesting that <a href="http://joseph.randomnetworks.com/archives/2008/04/28/sun-should-be-in-the-consumer-cloud-services-business/">Sun should offer cloud services</a> they <a href="http://www.sun.com/aboutsun/pr/2008-05/sunflash.20080505.3.xml">announced</a> that they would be supporting Amazon EC2 by having it run Sun&#8217;s OpenSolaris and offer MySQL support for instances running on top of EC2.  Nice, but not any where near what I&#8217;m hoping for.  So I started looking at the other side of the coin, what things are keeping Sun from being able to offer pay as you go consumer services?  One thing quickly came to mind: dealing with many payment transactions, often for small amounts.</p>
<p>The beauty of pay as you go cloud services is that you pay for what you use.  If you only use a small amount, you only pay a small amount.  My S3 bill each month rarely goes over $5, because I only use it in small amounts.  Amazon charges my credit card and sends me an email with the details.  But for most companies doing lots of credit card transactions for small amounts simply isn&#8217;t worth it.  The fees associated with credit card transactions add up fast when dealing with such small transactions.  At least for most companies.</p>
<p>Amazon has been doing large volumes of credit card transactions for a number of years, I&#8217;d be very surprised if they don&#8217;t have some custom fee structure for processing them.  When you do the volume of transactions that a company like Amazon does, that gives you a little more leverage.  So part of what has allowed Amazon to grow into the pay as go cloud services market is the fact that they already had a large payment system in place that allows them to process even fairly small transactions efficiently.</p>
<p>This gives <a href="http://checkout.google.com/">Google Checkout</a> an even more important role than just being a competitor to <a href="http://paypal.com/">PayPal</a>.  With AdWords and AdSense already going, Google already has plenty of reason to want the same sort of leverage Amazon has for processing payments.  With Google App Engine expected to have a similar pay as go structure as AWS, there will be even more focus on processing small amounts without taking a big hit on fees.</p>
<p>Now back to Sun.  As far as I know Sun has nothing that even comes close to Amazon&#8217;s volume of transactions or Google&#8217;s small fee services.  So they&#8217;ve had no reason to build up an efficient payment system that can handle small amounts.  This leaves them with two choices, build one to try and gain the needed leverage to reduce the fees involved, or partner with someone else who already has.  So far they&#8217;ve gone with the later, specifically Amazon and their EC2 service.</p>
<p>One way around the small transaction amount problem is to have customers pay in advance.  Sun could still offer pay as you go services, but you have pay for them upfront in $100 increments.  Each month your usage fee would be deducted from the amount you already paid them.  If I only used $10 this month, I&#8217;d still have $90 left in my account.  This isn&#8217;t nearly as attractive from the small customer side as simply paying $10 per month from their credit card, but not horrendous either, especially if you could get the minimum pay in advance amount down to something under $50.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d really like to see more competition in the cloud services space, but so far Amazon has it pretty much all to itself (which a small niche potentially going to Google App Engine).  And unless companies like Sun can find ways to process small payments efficiently we might not be seeing any for a long time to come.</p>
