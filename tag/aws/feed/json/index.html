Nice, but not any where near what I&#8217;m hoping for.  So I started looking at the other side of the coin, what things are keeping Sun from being able to offer pay as you go consumer services?

If you only use a small amount, you only pay a small amount.  My S3 bill each month rarely goes over $5, because I only use it in small amounts.  Amazon charges my credit card and sends me an email with the details.  But for most companies doing lots of credit card transactions for small amounts simply isn&#8217;t worth it.

When you do the volume of transactions that a company like Amazon does, that gives you a little more leverage.  So part of what has allowed Amazon to grow into the pay as go cloud services market is the fact that they already had a large payment system in place that allows them to process even fairly small transactions efficiently.</p>\n<p>This gives <a href=\"http://checkout.google.com/\">Google Checkout</a> an even more important role than just being a competitor to <a href=\"http://paypal.com/\">PayPal</a>.  With AdWords and AdSense already going, Google already has plenty of reason to want the same sort of leverage Amazon has for processing payments.  With Google App Engine expected to have a similar pay as go structure as AWS, there will be even more focus on processing small amounts without taking a big hit on fees.</p>\n<p>Now back to Sun.  As far as I know Sun has nothing that even comes close to Amazon&#8217;s volume of transactions or Google&#8217;s small fee services.  So they&#8217;ve had no reason to build up an efficient payment system that can handle small amounts.

Sun could still offer pay as you go services, but you have pay for them upfront in $100 increments.  Each month your usage fee would be deducted from the amount you already paid them.  If I only used $10 this month, I&#8217;d still have $90 left in my account.
