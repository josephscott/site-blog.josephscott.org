Just to see what others are doing and hopefully learn a few things along the way.  So here are a few notes about tinkering with <a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/redis/\">Redis</a>.</p>\n<h3>The short story</h3>\n<p>Created by Salvatore &#8220;antirez&#8221; Sanfilippo, Redis was first released in March 2009 and is under a BSD style license.</p>\n<p>Superficially Redis is like <a href=\"http://memcached.org/\">memcached</a> in that it is a memory based key/value store.

I recommend taking a few minutes to walk through the <a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/redis/wiki/IntroductionToRedisDataTypes\">introduction to redis data types</a> page.  After a few minutes going through the examples there you&#8217;ll have a basic idea of the data types: string, integer (special type of string really), lists, sets, and sorted sets and a few of the operations available for each type.

First, check out the <a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/redis/wiki/BlpopCommand\">blocking pop commands</a>.  This allows for one or more clients to block when popping data off an array.  If there is data in the array they immediately get that, and if there isn&#8217;t they will get immediately notified when a new item is added.  Now you&#8217;ve got a simple queueing system.</p>\n<p>After letting your imagination wander a bit with blocking pop go check out the <a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/redis/wiki/PublishSubscribe\">pub/sub commands</a>. The publish/subscribe (pub/sub) features in Redis allow you to easily listen for updates on a channel.  Other clients can then write updates to those channels.  *Poof* you&#8217;ve now got a simple message passing system.</p>\n<h3>Back to the data</h3>\n<p>I mentioned persistence of data as something that Redis provides.  There are two ways to do that, via snapshots and the append only file.  Both of these allow Redis to reload data after a restart.

A reasonable balance of speed with increased capacity.</p>\n<h3>More reading</h3>\n<p>I&#8217;ve really only scratched the surface of what Redis can do in these various areas.  The <a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/redis/wiki/index?tm=6\">documentation page</a> is a good place to pick up more details.
