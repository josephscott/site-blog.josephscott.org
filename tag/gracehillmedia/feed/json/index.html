After watching the movie though, it is quite funny.  There were several scenes in the movie that had everyone laughing.

The foul language used in this movie is completely over the top.  It seems that they can&#8217;t let a scene go with out squeezing in a few swear words.  At one point it felt like I was watching a 15 year old kid running around cussing, for no other reason than to demonstrate to others that he could.  Just because you are writing a comedy doesn&#8217;t mean that 35% of the dialogue has to be made of swear words.  Be brave enough to rely on your actors to make the film be funny.</p>\n<p>I rate this movie a 1 out of 5.  Better dialogue instead of constant foul language could have made this movie a 3 (maybe even 3.5) out 5.</p>\n",
