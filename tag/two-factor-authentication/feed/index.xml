										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Just so that I&#8217;m clear, here is the message:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Sending a code via SMS to a mobile phone does not count as Two Factor Authentication ( 2FA ).
</p></blockquote>
<p>I saw two things recently that brought up this issue again.  First, reading the account of someone who was hit with a SIM card swap attack &#8211; where someone else calls up your mobile carrier claiming to be you and has your phone number moved to a new SIM card.  That led to all sorts of pain from accounts that considered his phone number to be a trusted source of authentication.</p>
<p>The second trigger in all of this was seeing a notification from a financial institution that was going to start enabling &#8220;Two Factor Authentication&#8221; on accounts.  The default method was a code sent via SMS, and given the power of defaults I expect most people will pick that one.  Fortunately they do offer a way to use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-based_One-time_Password_algorithm">TOTP ( Time base One Time Password )</a> codes, so the situation wasn&#8217;t as bad as it could have been.</p>
<p>At best I&#8217;d call that 1.5FA instead of 2FA.</p>
<p>However, I&#8217;ve reached a point where any mention of SMS as a 2FA ( Two Factor Authentication ) option should come with a large warning in red blinking text about how this really isn&#8217;t what you want to do.</p>
<h3>What To Use Instead</h3>
<p>I strongly prefer the TOTP option instead, with a mobile app like <a href="https://authy.com/">Authy</a>, <a href="https://duo.com/">Duo</a>, <a href="https://freeotp.github.io/">FreeOTP</a>, or <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/google-authenticator/id388497605">Google Authenticator</a>.</p>
<p>Standard disclaimer applies here, nothing is perfect.  Using a TOTP app won&#8217;t give you perfect security ( I&#8217;d argue that doesn&#8217;t exist ), but it is miles better than no 2FA and significantly better than SMS tokens.</p>
