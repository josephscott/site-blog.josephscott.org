										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I recently noticed a pattern when I order something online.  Once the order is complete, I leave that tab in my browser open until I&#8217;ve made sure that a copy of the receipt is in my email.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been doing this for awhile now, not sure exactly when it started, but I definitely have a reason for it.  Once an order is complete, they display the receipt details.  I want to keep those details, but really don&#8217;t want to have to manually copy them down some where.  Instead I wait for the receipt email to show up, make sure it has the details I want ( so far they always have ), then close the tab.</p>
<p>This pattern of behavior has made me sensitive to the amount of time it takes for a receipt email to show up.  If it takes more than five minutes for a receipt email to show up, then I start getting that nagging feeling that it might never come.  Fortunately most show up long before my five minute threshold.</p>
<p>It is easy to take email for granted, but only as long as it continues to work within our expectations.  For me, that has become &#8220;receipt emails that take longer than five minutes to show up are broken some how&#8221;.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was surprised while looking at a site using the <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/">Cloudflare CDN</a> to see a piece of JavaScript I hadn&#8217;t come across before: <code>/cdn-cgi/scripts/5c5dd728/cloudflare-static/email-decode.min.js</code></p>
<p>Cloudflare has a feature called &#8220;Scrape Shield&#8221; that looks for pages with email addresses in them, then automatically injects this JavaScript to obfuscate the addresses.  The idea is to reduce the risk that bots will harvest the email address for spam.  This feature is turned out by default.</p>
<p>Turning it off ( if you want to do that ) is easy enough:</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/scrape-shield.png"><img loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/scrape-shield-1024x334.png" alt="" width="788" height="257" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-17289" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/scrape-shield-1024x334.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/01/scrape-shield-300x98.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/01/scrape-shield-768x250.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/01/scrape-shield-788x257.png 788w" sizes="(max-width: 788px) 100vw, 788px" /></a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Murphy&#8217;s law goes something like:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Anything that can go wrong, will go wrong.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I get a similar feeling when it comes to tech today:</p>
<blockquote><p>
If it can be done, someone will do it.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately that comes up more often for bad things that for good.  My case in point today: email and privacy.  Specifically some of the things that can be included in email messages that allow third parties to collect information.</p>
<p>To see what I mean, try out the <a href="https://emailprivacytester.com/">Email Privacy Tester</a>.  It will send you an email that contains many of these tracking methods and will report to you which ones worked ( after you open the email ).</p>
<p>Most of the time I&#8217;m using the Gmail web interface for email, which with my current setup triggered zero trackers ( aside from the obvious point that it allows <strike>Google</strike> Alphabet to track me more ):</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/email-privacy-gmail-1.png" rel="attachment wp-att-15172"><img loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/email-privacy-gmail-1-1024x743.png" alt="email-privacy-gmail" width="840" height="609" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-15172" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/email-privacy-gmail-1-1024x743.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/02/email-privacy-gmail-1-300x218.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/02/email-privacy-gmail-1-768x557.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/02/email-privacy-gmail-1.png 1037w" sizes="(max-width: 840px) 100vw, 840px" /></a></p>
<p>I tried this with Gmail on iOS, it also triggered zero trackers.</p>
<p>My current Apple Mail setup needs to be locked down more:</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/email-privacy-apple-mail-1.png" rel="attachment wp-att-15175"><img loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/email-privacy-apple-mail-1.png" alt="email-privacy-apple-mail" width="1006" height="776" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-15175" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/email-privacy-apple-mail-1.png 1006w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/02/email-privacy-apple-mail-1-300x231.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/02/email-privacy-apple-mail-1-768x592.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1006px) 100vw, 1006px" /></a></p>
<p>In 2016 you have to assume a more defensive position by default on these sorts of things.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Validating an email address with a regular expression is something nearly every developer struggles with.  So when I came across <a href="http://fightingforalostcause.net/misc/2006/compare-email-regex.php">Comparing E-mail Address Validating Regular Expressions</a> I wanted to make sure I left myself a note here so that I could find it again later <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>Several expressions were collected and run over an array of email string tests, so far this one has come out on top:</p>
<blockquote><p>
/^([w!#$%&amp;&#8217;*+-/=?^`{|}~]+.)*[w!#$%&amp;&#8217;*+-/=?^`{|}~]+@((((([a-z0-9]{1}[a-z0-9-]{0,62}[a-z0-9]{1})|[a-z]).)+[a-z]{2,6})|(d{1,3}.){3}d{1,3}(:d{1,5})?)$/i
</p></blockquote>
<p>Keep in mind that no regular expression can verify that an email address is actually legitimate, the only real test is to actually talk to the SMTP server responsible for that domain&#8217;s email and make sure it will accept it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Like so many other folks I&#8217;ve been routing my email through <a>Gmail</a>.  For me this was mostly about dealing with spam.  On an average day I get 300+, so off to Gmail it goes.  It&#8217;s never been perfect, usually letting through less than 10 a day, but that was manageable.  Now I&#8217;ve got a whole new problem.</p>
<p>Sometime after the new year (as far as I can tell) Gmail started marking legit emails as spam.  After trolling through my spam folder I found several emails that weren&#8217;t spam, so they never made it to my inbox.  Hard to make out exactly what the trend is, so far it&#8217;s about 10 a week.</p>
<p>I would much rather have some spam hit my inbox than to have legit email get marked as spam.  I&#8217;m now left with the reality that I&#8217;ll have to dig through the spam folder at the end of every day to make sure I didn&#8217;t miss anything, not a pleasant thought.  My confidence and happiness with Gmail has gone done several notches because of this.</p>
<p>Just in case this is a system wide issue you may want to take a peek at your Gmail spam folder and see if you are having the same problem.</p>
