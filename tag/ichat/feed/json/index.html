Feed Crier pushes RSS/ATOM feeds though <a href=\"http://www.aim.com/\">AIM</a> (other IM networks are reported to be supported later).

The free account allows you to subscribe up to 3 feeds.  The Pro account allows for unlimited feeds, no advertising (?), feed summaries and the ability to manage your feeds via the web.  I&#8217;m not sure if the no advertising feature of the Pro account means that that Feed Crier won&#8217;t display their own ads or if they&#8217;ll strip ads from feeds you subscribe to.</p>\n<p>I was able to subscribe to my own feed for this blog and got a quick response asking me to click on a URL to verify my subscription.

As a concept though I think this is a neat idea.  With the popularity of feeds this allows you to glue pretty much any data to your IM client.  I could see this being really useful for those who want to keep very close tabs on a feed.  And if you are using this on Mac OS X then <a href=\"http://growl.info/\">Growl</a> makes it even more awesome.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m curious how Adam is tracking updates to feeds.
