										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was looking for directions to the swimming pool that Alice has been taking swimming lessons at and I came across a rather odd street name: <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=Waynes+World+Dr,+Draper,+UT+84020&amp;sll=40.545412,-111.852421&amp;sspn=0.010175,0.022466&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;z=16&amp;iwloc=addr&amp;om=1">Waynes World Drive</a>, in <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=Draper,+UT&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;z=12&amp;iwloc=addr&amp;om=1">Draper, Utah</a> (only a few miles south of where I&#8217;m at).  At first I thought that maybe this was just incorrect data in Google Maps, so I drove down it check it out.  That is where I found this:</p>
<p><a href="http://flickr.com/photos/josephscott/1100243415/"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1121/1100243415_7d815a27c5.jpg" alt="Waynes World Drive" /></a></p>
<p>I drove up and down the length of the street and I could only find one street sign with Waynes World Drive on it (all the reset had 13800 South, also the name of the street.  It&#8217;s a long story).  I spent some time on Google trying to find some history on this, but all I found were mentions of the street name in Wikipedia on the Draper, UT and Wayne&#8217;s World pages.</p>
