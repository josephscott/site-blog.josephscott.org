										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For the software geeks in the house I recommend subscribing to <a href="http://jvns.ca/">Julia Evans</a>.  Many of her posts come up because of a question, then go on to detail what she found out while looking for the answer.  I&#8217;ll give you two recent examples to demonstrate what I mean.</p>
<p>First up: <a href="http://jvns.ca/blog/2016/03/01/a-few-notes-on-the-stack/">What is &#8220;the stack&#8221;?</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
The basic question I want to answer here is &#8212; why do people sometimes discuss &#8220;the stack&#8221; like it&#8217;s some kind of revered fundamental object? (the answer is going to turn out to be &#8220;because it is&#8221;, and I&#8217;m going to try to make that as concrete as I can.)
</p></blockquote>
<p>She then touches on C, assembly, Rust, and gdb to explain what she discovered.  Good stuff.</p>
<p>My next example: <a href="http://jvns.ca/blog/2016/03/12/how-does-perf-work-and-some-questions/">How does perf work? (in which we read the Linux kernel source)</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
So it turns out I don&#8217;t really know how perf works. And I like knowing how stuff works. Last week I read some of the man page for perf_event_open, the system call that perf uses. It&#8217;s 10,000 words but pretty helpful! I&#8217;m still quite confused about perf, so I&#8217;m going to tell you, fair reader, what I know, and then maybe you can help me out with my questions.
</p></blockquote>
<p>The result?  A little bit about CPUs and the Linux kernel.  Classic &#8220;source code is the ultimate truth&#8221; approach, excellent.</p>
<p>If you write code or read code, I recommend reading <a href="http://jvns.ca/">Julia Evans</a>.</p>
