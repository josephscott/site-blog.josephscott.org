<p>The folks at <a href="https://www.familysearch.org/">familysearch.org</a> have been developing a new site geared around family history being told through stories: <a href="http://kinfolio.com/?ref=1060">kinfolio.com</a>.</p>
<p>I had the opportunity to read through a preview of some of the ideas being developed for kinfolio.  One of the goals is clearly to make recording family history information as simple and direct as possible.  </p>
<p>Development is still on going, so if you go to <a href="http://kinfolio.com/?ref=1060">kinfolio.com</a> right now the only thing you can do is signup for email news and updates.</p>
<p>There are plenty of questions left about how exactly things will work.  For instance, if you already have family tree data at familysearch.org will you be able to import that information?  Will familysearch.org be able to import information from kinfolio?  Right now there isn&#8217;t an export feature for familysearch.org, will kinfolio have an export feature?  Hopefully more information will be made available prior to the site going live.</p>
<p>Either way the preview looked interesting enough that I&#8217;ll be giving the site a try once it goes live.</p>
