										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Since the economic markets started imploding in a major way earlier this year we&#8217;ve hear a lot about about &#8220;credit default swaps&#8221; (CDS).  I&#8217;ve seen a few attempts to explain what these particular financial tools are but still didn&#8217;t feel like I had a good grasp on what they were.</p>
<p>Last night <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/sections/60minutes/main3415.shtml">60 Minutes</a> had a segment on CDS (<a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/10/26/60minutes/main4546199.shtml">The Bet That Blew Up Wall Street</a>) which I think does a pretty good job of spelling out what these beasts are.  The audio is pretty poor, but it&#8217;s worth the 12 minutes and 26 seconds to watch:</p>

<p>After seeing this it seems pretty clear that the limitations the government removed eight years ago was not really a good idea.  Not one Senator voted against it.  Anyone know if they&#8217;ve learned their lesson and moved to make this illegal again?</p>
