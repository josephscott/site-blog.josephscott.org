In jQuery 1.6 we have updated this feature to match the W3C HTML5 spec with regards to camel-casing data attributes that have embedded dashes. So for example in jQuery 1.5.2, an attribute of data-max-value=&#8221;15&#8243; would create a data object of { max-value: 15 } but as of jQuery 1.6 it sets { maxValue: 15 }.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>The portion of the W3C HTML5 spec mentioned is <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/elements.html#embedding-custom-non-visible-data-with-the-data-attributes\">http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/elements.html#embedding-custom-non-visible-data-with-the-data-attributes</a> &#8211; and the specific wording in this regard is:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n<strong>element . dataset</strong><br />\nReturns a DOMStringMap object for the element&#8217;s data-* attributes.</p>\n<p>Hyphenated names become camel-cased. For example, data-foo-bar=&#8221;&#8221; becomes element.dataset.fooBar.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>My feelings on this are simple &#8211; this is an absolutely horrible idea!  Why would you indicate that implementations of the spec actually alter the attribute names used in the HTML?  The only result from this I can see is confusion and wasted time when code breaks from this but it isn&#8217;t obvious why.</p>\n<p>To make this even more confusing the data attribute section of the spec also mentions:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\nNote: All attributes on HTML elements in HTML documents get ASCII-lowercased automatically, so the restriction on ASCII uppercase letters doesn&#8217;t affect such documents.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>So even if you wanted to CamelCase your data attribute names, to avoid the auto conversion described in the spec, you can&#8217;t.  Using <code>data-CamelCase</code> would become <code>data-camelcase</code>.</p>\n<p>Where does all this leave the average web dev?  Well, I think the easiest way out is to never, ever, ever use a name for a data attribute that the spec indicates will be altered.  This means no dashes any where in the dev controlled section of data attribute names.  That isn&#8217;t very pretty since the attribute is required to start with <code>data-</code>, but it is the safest route. </p>\n<p> In practice this will result in either names with no breaks or using underscores where you would normally use dashes.  &#8220;Safe&#8221; examples would be:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>data-foobar</li>\n<li>data-foo_bar</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I&#8217;m really disappointed to see attribute name changes be part of the HTML5 spec.
