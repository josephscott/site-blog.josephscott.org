They did confirm though that they are talking, and that they have been talking for some time.

This could provide a similar benefit (increased speed/performance for traffic to Google from Verizon) by reducing the number of routers between Verizon customers and Google servers.  For instance between my home DSL connection from Qwest and www.google.com there are roughly 14 routers (according to traceroute).  Of those 5 are operated by Qwest, 4 by Level3, and 5 by Google (confirmed by whois lookup for each IP address in the traceroute results).  A peering arrangement between Qwest and Google would likely eliminate all 4 of the Level3 run routers and perhaps one or two more between Qwest and Google.
