										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Four years ago I was wondering <a href="https://josephscott.org/archives/2010/05/facebook-future/">when Facebook would get more aggressive with their ad network</a>.  It seemed pretty clear that at some point they&#8217;d move from selling ads only for Facebook properties and move to the broader web ( and apps ).  It looks like that time has come:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Facebook’s long-awaited Google AdSense competitor is finally here. It’s called Atlas, and it will allow brands to use the social network’s massive trove of data to target ads on sites across the web.
</p></blockquote>
<p>From <a href="http://www.wired.com/2014/09/facebook-launches-atlas/">Wired: Facebook Ads Will Now Follow You No Matter What Device You’re Using</a>.</p>
<p>In the era of iOS and Android the new holy grail of ads is following people around on every device they use.  Queue the &#8216;with great power comes great responsibility&#8217; requirements.</p>
<p>Once this is starts getting traction I expect to see people researching how to keep Facebook tracking localized at the device level.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Google recently announced that their ads are going Facebook style by including the image and name for your account as an endorsement on ads.  This came as <a href="http://www.google.com/policies/terms/changes/">part of an update to their terms of service</a>.</p>
<p>To opt out of this go to <a href="https://plus.google.com/settings/endorsements?hl=en">https://plus.google.com/settings/endorsements?hl=en</a>.</p>
<figure id="attachment_9172" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-9172" style="width: 913px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/google-endorsement-opt-out-1.jpg" alt="Make sure that box stays unchecked." width="913" height="67" class="size-full wp-image-9172" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/google-endorsement-opt-out-1.jpg 913w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/10/google-endorsement-opt-out-1-300x22.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/10/google-endorsement-opt-out-1-768x56.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 913px) 100vw, 913px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-9172" class="wp-caption-text">Make sure that box stays unchecked.</figcaption></figure>
<p>You will need to make sure that the checkbox towards the bottom of that page remains unchecked.</p>
<p>I wonder how long until Google starts showing derived endorsements on ads.  If you carry an Android device around they&#8217;ll be able to see what places your visit most frequently, which they might want to use as an implied endorsement.  That could make Google Now a huge source of ad related data.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last night I headed over to <a href="https://twitter.com/">Twitter.com</a> to check on the recent updates to my timeline.  Near the top I noticed something a little different:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-xFBaTM4eosI/TrieDe-d5oI/AAAAAAAAAP4/HbQm91EY4HI/s536/timeline-promoted.png" title="Twitter Timeline - Promotions" class="alignnone" width="536" height="437" /></p>
<p>Subtle isn&#8217;t it?  Just in case you missed it, here is the same screenshot with a highlight of the difference:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-BPlUHrOixhg/Trie3uNd_KI/AAAAAAAAAQQ/m6QLvKoWTfU/s536/timeline-promoted-annotate.png" title="Twitter Timeline - Promotions" class="alignnone" width="536" height="437" /></p>
<p>Twitter allowed <a href="http://www.linode.com/">Linode</a> to inject an ad (effectively) into my timeline.  In Twitterspeak this ad is called a &#8216;promotion&#8217;.</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t new of course, <a href="http://blog.twitter.com/2011/07/timely-tweets-now-easier-to-see.html">Twitter has been talking about <strike>ads</strike> promoted tweets</a> for months.  This the first time I&#8217;ve ever seen it show up in my timeline though.</p>
<p><a href="https://support.twitter.com/articles/142101-what-are-promoted-tweets">Twitter says these can show up in official apps</a> as well, but when I looked my at timeline with the official Twitter iOS app I didn&#8217;t see the <strike>ad</strike> promoted tweet:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-j-8iTS6OiKg/TrieDoaf53I/AAAAAAAAAP8/GFq-tLWMtOc/s480/iphone-twitter.png" title="Twitter Timeline - iOS" class="alignnone" width="320" height="480" /></p>
<p>I have mixed feelings about Twitter injecting <strike>ads</strike> &#8216;promotions&#8217; into my timeline.  The promoted trends in the sidebar on Twitter.com weren&#8217;t a problem.  They are clearly labeled as an <strike>ad</strike> promotion, making it easy to tell the difference between real trends and <strike>ads</strike> promotions.  Most of the time I only scan my timeline, skipping the trending items entirely.</p>
<p>Timeline <strike>ads</strike> promotions are a different beast though.  The visual difference is relatively small, making it easy to miss when scanning through tweets.  If it had a clear visual difference (different background color?) I think it would be less annoying to me since I&#8217;d know what to avoid when scanning recent tweets in my timeline.</p>
<p>Despite having taken <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/company/twitter">over $1.1 billion in funding</a> there is little doubt that they&#8217;ll have to do something to increase real revenue.  I can&#8217;t help but feel that my timeline is expected to be pure though, having <strike>ads</strike> promoted tweets inline with little visual distinction is a disappointment.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://publisher.yahoo.com/">Yahoo Publisher Network</a> (YPN) now supports having their <a href="https://publisher.yahoo.com/portal/AboutRSS.php">ads placed in feeds</a> (RSS, ATOM).  It looks like only <a href="http://www.sixapart.com/movabletype/">Movable Type</a> and <a href="http://www.wordpress.org/">WordPress</a> are currently supported.  <a href="https://publisher.yahoo.com/portal/RSSSetupGuide.php">Instructions for adding ads to your feeds</a> are provided, but the images they used are barely readable.  The WordPress screen shots are bordering on useless they are so difficult to read.  Somebody should have caught that before these instructions were posted.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve added the YPN ad feed code to the feeds for this blog to try this out.  If these ads work in a reasonable way then Yahoo may have taken a big step forward over <a href="http://www.google.com/adsense/">Google AdSense</a> by supporting WordPress in addition to Movable Type.</p>
