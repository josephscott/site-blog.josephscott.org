<p>It would be really handy if Gmail kept a list of my last dozen or so search terms.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been using the Gmail web interface quite a bit, and for the most part I&#8217;ve adjusted to how it works.  There is one thing that still bothers me though.  When you have an email thread open and a new email comes in on that same thread it adds a little update notice to the bottom of your browser window.  In the image above that is what the orange arrow is pointing to (the little yellow box at the bottom).</p>
<p>That&#8217;s all fine and good, except for one alloying aspect.  My mouse rarely hangs out at the bottom of the browser window.  All of the menu items are at the top, along with the bookmarks on the toolbar.  Even in the Gmail interface, all of the UI elements that I use the most are along the top (and on the left side).  So I end up making a special trip to the bottom of the screen just for that update notice.</p>
<p>So here&#8217;s my request, move the update notice box from the bottom of the screen, to some place near the top.  Looking around the Gmail UI it seems that right above the thick blue bar would be great, where the green arrow is pointing to above.  It&#8217;s a small change that would make the update notice box more pleasant to click on.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I really like <a href="http://getfirebug.com/">Firebug</a>, I highly recommend it (if you do web dev and haven&#8217;t used it then it is time to catch up).  While trying to debug a particular problem with an image not loading correctly, I thought of a new feature that would be really handy to have.</p>
<p>The HTML inspector is really great at taking you directly to the item on the page you&#8217;re interested in, but sometimes that isn&#8217;t enough.  I&#8217;d like to have an option to see the network request for that resource (an image in this case) on the &#8216;Net&#8217; panel.  I suppose it wouldn&#8217;t need to be part of the inspector, if I could right click on an img tag and have a menu option to go directly to the network request for that image that would be good enough.</p>
<p>Having the network requests broken out by type is a good start, but when you&#8217;ve got dozens of images loading on a single page scanning the list by file name isn&#8217;t very fun.</p>
<p>If this is something that is already available in Firebug and I&#8217;ve missed it please enlighten me in the comments below.</p>
