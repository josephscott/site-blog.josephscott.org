										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If this article from the New York Times is a representative sample of what <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/08/15/magazine/bad-paper-debt-collector.html">the world of debt collections</a> looks like then it is past time to look at better regulations ( emphasis is mine ):</p>
<blockquote><p>
As he soon discovered, after creditors sell off unpaid debts, those debts enter a financial netherworld where strange things can happen. A gamut of players — including debt buyers, collectors, brokers, street hustlers and criminals — all work together, and against one another, to recoup every penny on every dollar. In this often-lawless marketplace, large portfolios of debt — <strong>usually in the form of spreadsheets holding debtors’ names, contact information and balances</strong> — are bought, sold and sometimes simply stolen.
</p></blockquote>
<p>The idea that all you need to have to support your claim that you now own the rights to a specific amount of debt is an entry on a spreadsheet is terrifying.  Who lets a financial marketplace run in such a crazy fashion?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An op-ed piece in the New York Times by <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/16/opinion/krugman-moment-of-truthiness.html">Paul Krugman mentioned U.S. budget deficits</a> and their trends.  I&#8217;ve looked at the U.S. total federal debt ( <a href="https://josephscott.org/archives/2009/04/history-of-the-federal-debt/">History Of The Federal Debt</a> and <a href="https://josephscott.org/archives/2013/04/percentage-change-in-federal-debt-1958-2012/">Percentage Change in Federal Debt, 1958-2012</a> ) and this post by Mr. Krugman got me thinking about budget deficits.</p>
<p>Historical records for the U.S. federal budget, surpluses and deficits are available from <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/historicals">the Office of Management and Budget</a> site.  I downloaded <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/budget/fy2014/assets/hist01z1.xls">Table 1.1—Summary of Receipts, Outlays, and Surpluses or Deficits (-): 1789–2018</a>, a 39 KB Excel file.</p>
<p>Here are a few highlights of U.S. federal budget deficits and surpluses since 1900:</p>
<ul>
<li>From 1900 to 2012 there have been budget surpluses 31 times</li>
<li>From 1950 to 2012 there have been budget surpluses only 9 times</li>
<li>The largest single year surplus was in 1927, with a surplus of $1.155 billion ( billion, with a B! )</li>
<li>The largest deficit in a single year was 2009, with a monster deficit of $1.4 trillion ( with a T! )</li>
<li>There was a four year streak of budget surpluses from 1998 to 2001, the previous four year streak before that was all the back in the 1920s</li>
<li>Every year in the 1920s there was a budget surplus</li>
<li>The longest budget surplus streak was 1920 to 1930</li>
<li>The longest period without a surplus was 1970 to 1997</li>
<li>The first time the deficit exceeded one billion dollars was 1918, at $9 billion</li>
<li>The first time the deficit exceeded one hundred billion dollars was 1982, at $127.9 billion</li>
</ul>
<p>It has been 11 years since we last had a budget surplus. I hope that we don&#8217;t break the 1970 to 1997 streak for the longest period without a budget surplus.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve previously mentioned that the <a href="http://josephscott.org/archives/2009/04/history-of-the-federal-debt/">last time the US federal debt went down instead of up was 1957</a>.  This came up in a conversation again recently and I started thinking about the percentage change in the federal debt for each year.  I looked at the period from 1958 to 2012, what I would call the modern era of federal debt.</p>
<p>I went back to the <a href="http://www.treasurydirect.gov/govt/reports/pd/histdebt/histdebt.htm">federal debt records</a>, they go from 1790 to today.  Dumped that data into a spreadsheet, then calculated the percentage change for each year from 1958 &#8211; 2012.  I used the all actual numbers, I didn&#8217;t attempt to normalize them to 2012 dollars since each year is just a comparison of the year before.</p>
<p>Copying that into Google Charts Javascript code generates this graph:</p>

<p>You can mouse over each point to see the exact value for any given year.</p>
<p>A few observations on this graph.  First, these are all increases, no negative numbers.  Next, you&#8217;ll easily notice that the year with the largest percentage increase was 1983, at 20.5%.  The next highest increase was 2009, at 18.8%.</p>
<p>The highs weren&#8217;t what most surprised me in this data, it was the lows.  In 2000 the percentage increase in federal debt from 1999 was only 0.32%.  That is the smallest percentage increase since 1957.  I knew that we&#8217;d reduced the yearly budget deficits during that period, but I had no idea how close we were to actually reducing the total federal debt.</p>
<p>For 2000 the dollar increase of the federal debt was $17,907,308,271.43, or roughly $18 billion ( yes, billion with a b ).  That sounds like a significant amount, but compared to other years is very small.  To give you some idea of how small, in 2001 the percentage increase was 2.35%, the dollar amount was $133,285,202,313.20, more than 7 times the amount in 2000.</p>
<p>I wanted to know more about what it would have taken to actually reduce the total debt in 2000.  The <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BUDGET-2000-BUD/html/BUDGET-2000-BUD-9.htm">2000 budget request</a> expenditures were listed as $1,765 billion.  To keep things simple I&#8217;m looking at this from the point of view of how much in spending cuts we would have needed in the 2000 budget to clear $18 billion that could have been used to reduce the total federal debt.</p>
<p>A little bit of math shows that $18 billion was 1.02% of the $1,765 billion in spending listed in the <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BUDGET-2000-BUD/html/BUDGET-2000-BUD-9.htm">proposed 2000 federal budget</a>.</p>
<p>Lets say we could find 1.1% in reductions in the budget to go towards paying down the debt.  That would get us $19.4 billion.  The first $18 billion would go to cover the increase that happened in the debt, leaving a $1.4 billion reduction in the total federal debt.  That is only a tiny fraction of the $5,674 billion total debt in 2000, but it would have been the first time in more than 40 years that it went down instead of up.</p>
<p>All totally hypothetical and vastly over simplified, but this gave me a much clearer picture of the history of the federal debt.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tired of hearing about how bad the federal debt is?  Turns out <a href="https://www.pay.gov/paygov/forms/formInstance.html?agencyFormId=23779454">you can donate money to the United States Treasury to help pay off the public debt</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Thank you for your contribution which will be deposited to the account &#8220;Gifts to Reduce the Public Debt.&#8221; Your contribution is accepted under the provisions of 31 U.S.C. 3113 which authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to accept conditional gifts to the United States for the purpose of reducing the public debt.  These donations are voluntary, and no goods, services, or other considerations are provided to the donors.
</p></blockquote>
<p>It sounds like these donations are specifically limited to only paying down the public debt.</p>
<p>As of 31 October 2011 the <a href="http://www.treasurydirect.gov/govt/reports/pd/mspd/2011/opds102011.pdf">total public debt is $14,993,709,000,000</a>.  As of the <a href="http://www.census.gov/prod/cen2010/briefs/c2010br-01.pdf">2010 Census there are 308,745,538 people in America</a>, bringing the per person amount to roughly $48,563.33.  Not exactly a trivial amount.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d be curious to know how many people donate to that account and approximately what those amounts look like.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My post about <a href="http://josephscott.org/archives/2009/03/presidents-that-have-reduced-the-federal-debt/">Presidents That Have Reduced The Federal Debt</a> was limited to data from 1940 to the present.  This was because the data I&#8217;d found (<a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/fy2009/pdf/hist.pdf">2009 Budget Historical Tables</a> PDF and the <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/fy2004/sheets/hist07z1.xls">Federal Debt at the End of Year: 1940–2008</a> XLS) only went back to 1940.  A little more digging revealed that <a href="http://treasurydirect.gov/">TreasuryDirect.gov</a> has a complete list of the <a href="http://www.treasurydirect.gov/govt/reports/pd/histdebt/histdebt.htm">history of annual outstanding federal debt</a> from 1791 to today.</p>
<p>The federal debt started at $75,463,476.52, in 1791.  It reached it&#8217;s lowest point, $33,733.05, in 1835 when Andrew Jackson was President.  Other milestones include the first time the debt passed $1 billion in 1863 under Abraham Lincoln and exceeding $1 trillion in 1982 during Ronald Reagan&#8217;s Presidency.  On the other side of the coin Woodrow Wilson was the first President to reduce the debt by more than $1 billion in a single year (1920).  The single largest reduction in the debt in a single year happened in 1947, by more than $11 billion, when Harry S. Truman was President.  Since 1791 the year over year debt has only been reduced 80 times under 29 different Presidents.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a list of all the years that the federal debt went down, including by how much and who the President was at the time:</p>
<ul>
<li>1794 &#8211; $1.9 million &#8211; George Washington</li>

</ul>
<p>There&#8217;s the complete list of every year in this country&#8217;s history where the year over year federal debt went down instead of up.</p>
<p>The debt has been reduced 36.6 percent of the time over the previous 218 years covered by this data.  Most of those reductions ( 73 percent ) happened during the 1800s.</p>
<p>Another interesting note that I hadn&#8217;t thought about until reviewing this list is that up until 1957 we had never gone more than 17 years without paying down some of the debt.  That gap was from 1930 to 1947, with a depression and war undoubtedly being major factors there.  The next largest gap was 10 years, 1857 to 1867.  The gap was normally much smaller though, with the average between 1791 and 1957 being just under 2 years.  The distribution of gaps during that time frame was: 17 years (1), 10 years (1), 6 years (3), 5 years (4), 4 years (2), 3 years (3), 2 years (7) and 1 year (57).</p>
<p>If/when we do reduce the federal debt again it will be the single largest gap between reductions in the history of this country, more than 3 times (at least) the length of the previous longest gap of 17 years.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Update &#8211; 6 Mar 2009 @ 8:05pm</strong> : <a href="http://josephscott.org/archives/2009/04/history-of-the-federal-debt/">History Of The Federal Debt</a> &#8211; I found data on the yearly federal debt amount from 1791 through present day</p>
<p>Frontline recently had an episode called <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/tentrillion/">Ten Trillion and Counting</a>, about the federal government&#8217;s debt, which is now <a href="http://www.treasurydirect.gov/NP/BPDLogin?application=np">over $11 trillion</a>.  This made me wonder, when was the last time the federal debt went down year over year?  To figure this out I looked at the <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/fy2004/sheets/hist07z1.xls">Federal Debt at the End of Year: 1940–2008</a> XLS spreadsheet.  This information is also available from the <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/fy2009/pdf/hist.pdf">2009 Budget Historical Tables</a> PDF on pages 127 and 128.</p>
<p>Since 1940 the federal debt has only dropped year over year five times: 1947 (by 13.8 billion), 1948 (by 5.1 billion), 1951 (by 1.5 billion), 1956 (by 1.6 billion) and 1957 (by 0.4 billion).  In the last 70 years we&#8217;ve only reduced the federal debt 7% percent of the time.  It&#8217;s been more than 50 years since the last time the federal debt was reduced.</p>
<p>The first three times the debt was paid down (1947, 1948 and 1951) <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/about/presidents/harrystruman/">Harry S. Truman</a> was President.  Perhaps he was serious about his <a href="http://www.trumanlibrary.org/buckstop.htm">The Buck Stops Here</a> sign.  The two most recent years the debt was reduced (1956 and 1957) were under President <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/about/presidents/dwightdeisenhower/">Dwight D. Eisenhower</a>.</p>
<p>Every President (and Congress) since 1957 has added to the federal debt.  Makes you wonder when, or if, this trend will ever turn around.</p>
