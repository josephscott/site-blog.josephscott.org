Turns out you can donate money to the United States Treasury to help pay off the public debt:\n\nThank you for your contribution which will be deposited to the account &#8220;Gifts to Reduce the Public Debt.&#8221; Your contribution is accepted under the provisions of 31 U.S.C. 3113 which authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to accept conditional gifts to the United States for the purpose of reducing the public debt.  These donations are voluntary, and no goods, services, or other considerations are provided to the donors.\n\nIt sounds like these donations are specifically limited to only paying down the public debt.\nAs of 31 October 2011 the total public debt is $14,993,709,000,000.  As of the 2010 Census there are 308,745,538 people in America, bringing the per person amount to roughly $48,563.33.  Not exactly a trivial amount.\nI&#8217;d be curious to know how many people donate to that account and approximately what those amounts look like.",

This was because the data I&#8217;d found (<a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/fy2009/pdf/hist.pdf\">2009 Budget Historical Tables</a> PDF and the <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/fy2004/sheets/hist07z1.xls\">Federal Debt at the End of Year: 1940\u20132008</a> XLS) only went back to 1940.  A little more digging revealed that <a href=\"http://treasurydirect.gov/\">TreasuryDirect.gov</a> has a complete list of the <a href=\"http://www.treasurydirect.gov/govt/reports/pd/histdebt/histdebt.htm\">history of annual outstanding federal debt</a> from 1791 to today.</p>\n<p>The federal debt started at $75,463,476.52, in 1791.  It reached it&#8217;s lowest point, $33,733.05, in 1835 when Andrew Jackson was President.  Other milestones include the first time the debt passed $1 billion in 1863 under Abraham Lincoln and exceeding $1 trillion in 1982 during Ronald Reagan&#8217;s Presidency.  On the other side of the coin Woodrow Wilson was the first President to reduce the debt by more than $1 billion in a single year (1920).  The single largest reduction in the debt in a single year happened in 1947, by more than $11 billion, when Harry S. Truman was President.
