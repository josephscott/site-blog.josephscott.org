										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Speaking of <a href="https://josephscott.org/archives/2015/05/ten-years-of-flickr-at-yahoo/">2005 Yahoo deals</a>, here is another: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20051211085824/http://blog.del.icio.us/blog/2005/12/yahoo.html#comment-11975076">del.icio.us sells to Yahoo</a>.  Not a good sign that <a href="https://josephscott.org/archives/2005/12/yahoo-buys-delicious/">my original Yahoo and Del.iciou.us announcement links</a> both return error pages now.  <a href="https://archive.org/">Internet Archive</a> saves the day ( and history ) yet again.</p>
<p>This lasted six years, after which <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/04/27/yahoo-sells-delicious-to-youtube-founders/">Yahoo sold Delicious to the founders of YouTube</a> ( in 2011 ).</p>
<p>Based on my personal usage, I&#8217;d grade the Flickr purchase better than the Delicious one.  I still use Flickr, but haven&#8217;t touched Delicious in a very long time.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was thinking a little bit about the Yahoo/Google/Microsoft battles this morning.  Sure, I almost always uses Google for search, but then it dawned on me that there is a Yahoo site that I use on a regular basis (if not daily, darn close to it), <a href="http://del.icio.us/">del.icio.us</a>.  It is far and away the Yahoo service that I use the most.  Coming in second would have to be Flickr, but that is a pretty distant second.</p>
<p>It has been almost two years since Yahoo purchased del.icio.us.  And more than a year since I&#8217;ve seen any talk about how much traffic they get.  It would be nice to get an anniversary update.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So now <a href="http://www.yahoo.com/">Yahoo</a> has purchased <a href="http://del.icio.us/">Del.icio.us</a>.  There aren&#8217;t many details in the <a href="http://blog.del.icio.us/blog/2005/12/yahoo.html">announcement</a>, so we&#8217;ll have to wait and see where this goes.  Hopefully this goes better than the purchase of <a href="http://blo.gs/">Blo.gs</a>, which has been up and down since their buyout.  The Blo.gs home page has been down for the last few days, with a note indicating that it should be back up in a few days (as of 7 Dec 2005).</p>
<p>Although some people were pretty ticked off with having to merge their Yahoo and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/">Flickr</a> accounts after Flickr was bought out, for the most part it seems to have been operating well since then.  I&#8217;m sure everyone will be wondering if they same sort of account merger will happen, especially given Yahoo&#8217;s <a href="http://myweb2.search.yahoo.com/">My Web 2.0</a> service.  Will they try to merge everything into My Web 2.0?</p>
<p>I suspect that the growth of Del.icio.us made this move a given.  Without more money and resources it would be difficult to continue operations with the type of growth they&#8217;ve seen.</p>
<p>Okay Yahoo, this is another change to win people over, by not screwing this up.  Loyal customers aren&#8217;t made when you sell them something, they are made when you fix things that are broken.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE 12:20pm 9 Dec 2005:</strong> Yahoo also has an <a href="http://www.ysearchblog.com/archives/000223.html">announcement of the purchase on their blog</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday the <a href="http://del.icio.us/help/firefox/extension">official del.icio.us Firefox extension</a> was <a href="http://blog.del.icio.us/blog/2005/11/extend_your_fir.html">announced</a>.  I&#8217;ve installed it on Firefox 1.5 on Mac OS X and it is awesome.  The various tagging options is great, especially being able to highlight text and use that as the expanded description.  You can search your del.icio.us bookmarks directly from the Firefox search field.  I&#8217;ve only noticed one big thing that is missing so far: bookmark backup and/or syncing.  The other Firefox plugins for syncing and/or backuping up your del.icio.us bookmarks aren&#8217;t that great, so I&#8217;d hoped that this extension would have filled in that problem space also.  Except for that omission this extension is a must for any del.icio.us user in my book.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure why it took so long for this come out, but this I&#8217;m thrilled that it is finally here.</p>
