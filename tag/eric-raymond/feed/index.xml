										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last week <strike>Freecode</strike> Freshmeat was converted to an all static site and <a href="http://freecode.com/about">effectively shutdown</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
The Freecode site has been moved to a static state effective June 18, 2014 due to low traffic levels and so that folks will focus on more useful endeavors than site upkeep.
</p></blockquote>
<p>While I have a strong sentimental feeling towards Freshmeat, it has been years since I&#8217;ve actually used the site for anything.</p>
<p>A few <a href="http://jeffcovey.net/2014/06/19/freshmeat-net-1997-2014/">memories of freshmeat.net</a> from Jeff Covey.</p>
<p>Eric Raymond follows up that story with background about <a href="http://esr.ibiblio.org/?p=5945">why VA Linux purchased Andover</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
In fact, buying Slashdot was my idea, and I had a solid reason for proposing it.<br />
&#8230;<br />
the U.S.’s crazy accounting rules more or less forced us to do an acquisition to maintain our valuation.<br />
&#8230;<br />
Then I said “At Linux conferences, think about which of these crews our people puppy-pile with on the beanbag chairs.” Light began to dawn on several faces. “The Slashdot guys. It has to be Andover, ” I said.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Eric Raymond ( ESR ) is the same person who wrote this rather odd announcement that <a href="http://www.linuxtoday.com/infrastructure/1999121000105NWLF">the VA Linux IPO made him rich</a>.  It reads just as strange now, 15 years later, as it did back then.  I hope he sold most it soon after that, because it went on to <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/business/article/VA-Linux-Easy-Come-Easy-Go-Stock-s-dramatic-2962977.php#photo-2263251">tank hard</a>.</p>
