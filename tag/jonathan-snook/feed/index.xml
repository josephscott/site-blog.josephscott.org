										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From <a href="https://snook.ca/archives/opinion/make-the-right-things-easy">Jonathan Snook</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Make the right things easy and the wrong things hard.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I like this idea from a user experience point of view.  How many times have you thought &#8220;oh, this should be easy&#8221;, only to discover it involved hunting for three different hidden links, and filling out a form that required five times as many clicks and steps as it really needed.</p>
<p>When you find yourself thinking the number of clicks to accomplish a task could be easily cut in half, then you are probably <strong>not</strong> making the right things easy.</p>
<p>Looking at a single page or screen, ideally it would be really clear what we want the user to accomplish.  If it isn&#8217;t clear, or if accomplishing it is significantly harder than doing something else, then it is worth rethinking your approach.</p>
<p>The developer version of this reminds me of <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Larry_Wall">Larry Wall on Perl</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Easy things should be easy, and hard things should be possible.
</p></blockquote>
<p>From a code point of view, hard things should still be possible.  But the easy things shouldn&#8217;t be made more difficult because of those hard things.</p>
