										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When I look at the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/">AWS Global Infrastructure</a> map I&#8217;m surprised at the lack of entries for Canada.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/aws-global-locations-1.png"><img loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/aws-global-locations-1-1024x580.png" alt="aws-global-locations" width="660" height="374" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-14572" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/aws-global-locations-1-1024x580.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/12/aws-global-locations-1-300x170.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/12/aws-global-locations-1-768x435.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/12/aws-global-locations-1-1200x680.png 1200w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/12/aws-global-locations-1.png 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px" /></a></p>
<p>First priority for global infrastructure is clearly to be in spots around the globe.  To some degree that has been accomplished, with more locations planned for the future.</p>
<p>One of those &#8216;coming soon&#8217; locations in Ohio.  I have nothing against Ohio, I just thought it was an odd decision compared to some place in Canada.</p>
<p>You might be wondering why I suggested Canada.  While Canada is only the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_and_dependencies_by_population">37th largest country by population</a>, it is a different story when it comes to trade with the United States.</p>
<p>What country is ranked number one in <a href="https://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/statistics/highlights/top/top1412yr.html">total trade with the United States</a>?  You might think it was China, and they are very high on the list ( #2 ).  Turns out Canada is #1, ahead of China by 11.4%.</p>
<p>For that reason alone I would have guessed that AWS would open up a location in Canada before Ohio.</p>
