I&#8217;ll be talking about techniques for measuring the performance of your site, making goals for what you&#8217;d like it to be and tips on how to speed things up.  Some of these will apply more broadly to just about any site on the web, then we&#8217;ll go into more specific WordPress options for better performance.</p>\n<p>The early bird tickets are still available, for only $15 (which includes lunch and t-shirt).  After August 27th the ticket price goes up to $20.  We are trying to encourage people to signup early because it makes getting accurate numbers for t-shirt and lunch orders easier.  So go hit the <a href=\"http://2011.slc.wordcamp.org/registration/\">WordCamp SLC 2011 registration page</a> today and save yourself a few dollars.</p>\n<p>I look forward to seeing everyone again up at the University of Utah on September 10th.</p>\n",
