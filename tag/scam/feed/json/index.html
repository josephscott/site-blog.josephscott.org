            "content_html": "<p>We recently received a phone call from a company called &#8220;Franklin Financial&#8221; about our home that was listed as being in foreclosure.  Things that tipped us off were, we have no mortgages/loans/credit cards or any sort of financial dealings with any company called Franklin Financial.  Second, we make all of our payments on time (early even!), so anyone claiming that we&#8217;d defaulted on a loan with be incorrect at best.  The call was very brief, after telling them they must be mistaken we hung up.</p>\n<p>This got me to thinking, they are probably looking to scam folks.  The caller ID listed the phone number at (410) 612-8139.  A quick search on Google indicated <a href=\"http://800notes.com/Phone.aspx/1-410-612-8139\">someone else caught the same call</a>.  I called the number back to see what the answering service said was the name of the company.  The recording says the name too fast for me to be sure, I think it&#8217;s something like WestArm.  The address was a bit slower though: 626 Towne Center Drive, Joppa, MD.
