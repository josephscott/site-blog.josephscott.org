										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This month I wanted to try learning the piano basics of a simplified Christmas song.  I started going through our copy of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Hymns-Church-Jesus-Christ-Latter-day/dp/B000V1RXQW">Hymns Made Easy</a> and settled on &#8220;Joy To The World&#8221; ( <a href="https://www.lds.org/bc/content/shared/english/pdf/callings/music/hymns-made-easy/Hymns_000_HymnsMadeEasy_eng.pdf?lang=eng">#56 in this PDF version</a> ).  It met all of the criteria I was looking for:</p>
<ul>
<li>A well known Christmas song</li>
<li>No sharps</li>
<li>No flats</li>
<li>Looked relatively easy</li>
</ul>
<p>I should add that I briefly took piano lessons as a kid.  About the only thing I remember from that period today is &#8220;Every Good Boy Does Fine&#8221;.</p>
<p>After a couple of days I can now mostly play the right hand of the simplified version version of &#8220;Joy To the World&#8221;.  The sound is very basic, but it is close enough that you&#8217;d probably recognize the tune.</p>
<p>While anyone with even moderate piano skills would laugh at how basic this version is, I found it satisfying to learn.  There are some patterns in the song that my fingers like.</p>
<p>I totally cheated to learn this song.  I can&#8217;t tell you what the notes are, instead I learned the pattern for playing them.  This isn&#8217;t a good long term approach, but that wasn&#8217;t my goal.</p>
<p>Thank you my wife and oldest daughter who were kind enough to answer my questions and correct my mistakes.</p>
<p>We are still early enough in the Christmas season that I&#8217;m going to try another song.</p>
