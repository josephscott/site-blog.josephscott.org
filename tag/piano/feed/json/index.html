It met all of the criteria I was looking for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A well known Christmas song</li>\n<li>No sharps</li>\n<li>No flats</li>\n<li>Looked relatively easy</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I should add that I briefly took piano lessons as a kid.  About the only thing I remember from that period today is &#8220;Every Good Boy Does Fine&#8221;.</p>\n<p>After a couple of days I can now mostly play the right hand of the simplified version version of &#8220;Joy To the World&#8221;.  The sound is very basic, but it is close enough that you&#8217;d probably recognize the tune.</p>\n<p>While anyone with even moderate piano skills would laugh at how basic this version is, I found it satisfying to learn.  There are some patterns in the song that my fingers like.</p>\n<p>I totally cheated to learn this song.  I can&#8217;t tell you what the notes are, instead I learned the pattern for playing them.  This isn&#8217;t a good long term approach, but that wasn&#8217;t my goal.</p>\n<p>Thank you my wife and oldest daughter who were kind enough to answer my questions and correct my mistakes.</p>\n<p>We are still early enough in the Christmas season that I&#8217;m going to try another song.</p>\n",
