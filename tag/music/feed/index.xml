The smallest pipe is a quarter-inch in length. More than 8,000 pipes were added to the Organ between 1911 and 1917, and from 1924 to 1930 an additional 10,000 pipes were installed, bringing the total number of pipes today to 28,500.
</p></blockquote>
<p>From <a href="http://www.wanamakerorgan.com/">Friends of the Wanamaker Organ</a>.  They have an informational video that covers some of the history of this enormous musical instrument:</p>
<a href="/2015/08/16/the-wanamaker-organ/"><img src="/wp-content/plugins/wp-youtube-lyte/lyteCache.php?origThumbUrl=%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FlOdahW5ePlY%2Fhqdefault.jpg" alt="YouTube Video"></a><br /><br /></p>
<p>From the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wanamaker_Organ">Wikipedia page</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
The pipes are laid out across five floors, with the sections situated as follows:</p>
<p> &#8211; 2nd floor south – Main Pedal 32′, Lower Swell, Great, Percussions<br />
 &#8211; 3rd floor south – Main Pedal, Chorus, Upper Swell, Choir/Enclosed Great, Solo, Vox Humana Chorus<br />
 &#8211; 4th floor south – String<br />
 &#8211; 4th floor west – Orchestral (adjacent to String)<br />
 &#8211; 7th floor south – Major Chimes, Ethereal, Chinese Gong<br />
 &#8211; 7th floor north – Echo</p>
<p>The 32′ Wood Open, 32′ Diaphone, and 32′ Metal Diapason pipes run the length of a little more than 2 stories, beginning on the second floor.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Amazing.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Wondering how Steve Jobs feels about the DRM they are required to include in music from the iTunes Music Store?  Wonder no longer: <a href="http://www.apple.com/hotnews/thoughtsonmusic/">Thoughts on Music</a> by Steve Jobs.  There&#8217;s some great stuff in there (emphasis mine):</p>
<blockquote><p>
Today’s most popular iPod holds 1000 songs, and research tells us that the average iPod is nearly full.  This means that <b>only 22 out of 1000 songs, or under 3% of the music on the average iPod, is purchased from the iTunes store and protected with a DRM</b>. The remaining 97% of the music is unprotected and playable on any player that can play the open formats.  Its hard to believe that just 3% of the music on the average iPod is enough to lock users into buying only iPods in the future.  And since 97% of the music on the average iPod was not purchased from the iTunes store, iPod users are clearly not locked into the iTunes store to acquire their music.
</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>
The third alternative is to abolish DRMs entirely. Imagine a world where every online store sells DRM-free music encoded in open licensable formats. In such a world, any player can play music purchased from any store, and any store can sell music which is playable on all players. This is clearly the best alternative for consumers, and Apple would embrace it in a heartbeat. <b>If the big four music companies would license Apple their music without the requirement that it be protected with a DRM, we would switch to selling only DRM-free music on our iTunes store. Every iPod ever made will play this DRM-free music.</b>
</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>
In 2006, <b>under 2 billion DRM-protected songs were sold worldwide by online stores, while over 20 billion songs were sold completely DRM-free  and unprotected on CDs by the music companies themselves.</b> The music companies sell the vast majority of their music DRM-free, and show no signs of changing this behavior, since the overwhelming majority of their revenues depend on selling CDs which must play in CD players that support no DRM system.
</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>
Perhaps those unhappy with the current situation should redirect their energies towards persuading the music companies to sell their music DRM-free.  For Europeans, two and a half of the big four music companies are located right in their backyard.  The largest, Universal, is 100% owned by Vivendi, a French company.  EMI is a British company, and Sony BMG is 50% owned by Bertelsmann, a German company.  <b>Convincing them to license their music to Apple and others DRM-free will create a truly interoperable music marketplace.  Apple will embrace this wholeheartedly.</b>
</p></blockquote>
<p>This could be a very big day for the future on online distribution of music.  Here&#8217;s hoping that Steve is able to pull this off, I&#8217;d love to have DRM free music available from the iTunes Music Store.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Looks like <a href="http://weirdal.com/">Weird Al</a> is back with a new album, Straight Outta Lynwood.  The new single is <a href="http://www.dontdownloadthissong.com/DDTSecard.html">Don&#8217;t Download This Song</a>, which you can of course download in MP3 format.  The video is going up <a href="http://music.yahoo.com/premieres">Yahoo! Music</a> tomorrow (23 August).  Additional info is available on <a href="http://myspace.com/weirdal">Al&#8217;s MySpace</a> site.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been a Weird Al fan since I first heard Eat It in 1983/84.  Just the other night I was watching the DVD of <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098546/">UHF</a> with the commentary track on.  Did you know that <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0798534/">Trinidad Silva</a> (Raul Hernandez, Raul&#8217;s Wild Kingdom) died during the filming of UHF?</p>
<p>At any rate, I look forward to seeing what Al&#8217;s got on the new album.  Oh yeah, it better be available via <a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/">iTunes</a> so that I can download it <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you&#8217;ve been reading this blog for awhile you already know that <a href="http://joseph.randomnetworks.com/archives/2005/01/28/information-society/">I&#8217;m a fan of Information Society</a>.  So I was pretty excited to hear Kurt Harland <a href="http://www.insoc.org/">announce</a> that the band name Information Society had been turned over to Paul Robb, who is reconstituting the band at <a href="http://informationsociety.us/">informationsociety.us</a>.  Unfortunately <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/insoc/53340.html">Kurt will not be involved</a>, so the <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/insoc/52444.html">new Information Society consists of Paul Robb, James Cassidy, Christopher Anton (vocals) &amp; Sonja Meyers (keyboards)</a>.</p>
<p>I want to have high hopes for the new Information Society.  I&#8217;ve started going through the <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/insoc/">Live Journal Information Society community</a> and their <a href="http://www.myspace.com/informationsociety">MySpace music site</a>, which has a few tracks that you can listen to.  They also have a <a href="http://blog.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.ListAll&amp;friendID=33986752&amp;MyToken=77cf414d-96f2-4a12-b542-67b3e9276eebML">MySpace blog</a>, but the only thing there is the original announcement.</p>
<p>Only time will tell if Christopher Anton will be able to do well in Kurt Harland&#8217;s shoes.  If they do put out a new CD I&#8217;ll likely buy it just to see how it turned out.</p>
<p>If you long for the good old days there are lots of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search=information+society&amp;search_type=search_videos&amp;search=Search">Information Society videos on You Tube</a>.</p>
