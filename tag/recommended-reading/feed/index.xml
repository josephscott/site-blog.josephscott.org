										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For the software geeks in the house I recommend subscribing to <a href="http://jvns.ca/">Julia Evans</a>.  Many of her posts come up because of a question, then go on to detail what she found out while looking for the answer.  I&#8217;ll give you two recent examples to demonstrate what I mean.</p>
<p>First up: <a href="http://jvns.ca/blog/2016/03/01/a-few-notes-on-the-stack/">What is &#8220;the stack&#8221;?</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
The basic question I want to answer here is &#8212; why do people sometimes discuss &#8220;the stack&#8221; like it&#8217;s some kind of revered fundamental object? (the answer is going to turn out to be &#8220;because it is&#8221;, and I&#8217;m going to try to make that as concrete as I can.)
</p></blockquote>
<p>She then touches on C, assembly, Rust, and gdb to explain what she discovered.  Good stuff.</p>
<p>My next example: <a href="http://jvns.ca/blog/2016/03/12/how-does-perf-work-and-some-questions/">How does perf work? (in which we read the Linux kernel source)</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
So it turns out I don&#8217;t really know how perf works. And I like knowing how stuff works. Last week I read some of the man page for perf_event_open, the system call that perf uses. It&#8217;s 10,000 words but pretty helpful! I&#8217;m still quite confused about perf, so I&#8217;m going to tell you, fair reader, what I know, and then maybe you can help me out with my questions.
</p></blockquote>
<p>The result?  A little bit about CPUs and the Linux kernel.  Classic &#8220;source code is the ultimate truth&#8221; approach, excellent.</p>
<p>If you write code or read code, I recommend reading <a href="http://jvns.ca/">Julia Evans</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve never used <a href="http://www.etsy.com/">etsy.com</a>, but they&#8217;ve got a great technical blog at <a href="http://codeascraft.etsy.com/">codeascraft.etsy.com</a>.  If you do web dev work, then Code as Craft should be required reading.</p>
<p>Here are a few examples of why I put Code as Craft on my <a href="http://josephscott.org/archives/tag/recommended-reading/">recommended reading</a> list:</p>
<p><a href="http://codeascraft.etsy.com/2012/03/13/making-it-virtually-easy-to-deploy-on-day-one/">Making it Virtually Easy to Deploy on Day One</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
At Etsy we have one hard and fast rule for new Engineers on their first day: deploy to production.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Last week I wrote about <a href="http://josephscott.org/archives/2012/07/the-joy-of-deploy/">the joy of deploy</a>.  Being able to see something your wrote (even if it is just a small change) go live is a great feeling.  It encourages you do it again (and again, and again), which is the life blood of web dev.</p>
<p><a href="http://codeascraft.etsy.com/2010/05/20/quantum-of-deployment/">Quantum of Deployment</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
whatâ€™s the smallest number of steps, with the smallest number of people and the smallest amount of ceremony required to get new code running on your servers?
</p></blockquote>
<p>Deployment is a big deal.  If deploying is an elaborate marching band process then things are likely going to be more painful.  Why?  Because deploy isn&#8217;t just about new features, it is about small bug fixes too.  Deploy should be fast and light, just like your development process.</p>
<p><a href='http://codeascraft.etsy.com/2012/07/12/june-2012-site-performance-report/'>June 2012 Site Performance Report</a></p>
<blockquote><p>
The median and 95th percentile times for core pages
</p></blockquote>
<p>First, it is just cool that they are tracking this type of information and are posting publicly about it.  Second, great to see them tracking 95th percentile and not just the median (or average).  Check out <a href="http://josephscott.org/archives/2010/02/thinking-clearly-about-performance/">thinking clearly about performance</a> for why things like 95th percentile are so important and why averages can hide what is really going on.</p>
<p>Kudos to the folks as Etsy for having a great tech blog: <a href="http://codeascraft.etsy.com/">codeascraft.etsy.com</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you are really into the nuts and bolts of data centers, large scale networks, and large scale computing then <a href="http://perspectives.mvdirona.com/">James Hamilton</a>&#8216;s posts make for some good reading.  He&#8217;s a &#8220;Vice President and Distinguished Engineer on the Amazon Web Services team&#8221;, which is really just the tip of the iceberg in his <a href="http://mvdirona.com/jrh/work/">work history</a>.</p>
<p>So why read his posts?  Because he talks about some of the hard problems faced in the world of data centers.  Take for instance his recent <a href="http://perspectives.mvdirona.com/2010/04/09/HighScaleNetworkResearch.aspx">High Scale Network Research</a> post.  How would you put together a reasonably priced test bed to stress your new network configuration/hardware that has to support 10,000 servers?</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll be honest, I don&#8217;t fully understand everything that James writes.  That&#8217;s part of the reason why he&#8217;s on my recommended reading list, trying to follow along makes me work intellectually.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Although I link to various sites when something interesting comes up, I haven&#8217;t done a good job of recommending people and blogs to follow.  Time to fix that.</p>
<p>Kicking off my recommended reading list is the <a href="http://www.stevesouders.com/blog/">High Performance Web Sites</a> blog by <a href="http://stevesouders.com/">Steve Souders</a>.  I&#8217;ll make this very simple, if you do web development at all this blog is <b>REQUIRED</b> reading.  When it comes to front end web performance Steve has literally written the book on the subject (<a href="http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596529307/">High Performance Web Sites</a>), twice (<a href="http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596522315/">Even Faster Web Sites</a>).</p>
<p>I was at his <a href="http://2009.sf.wordcamp.org/speakers/#steve">WordCamp SF 2009 session</a> where he made changes to a test site during the session and showed how each change improved the page load time.  If you aren&#8217;t able to make it to an event where Steve is speaking several of his session videos are online, like this <a href="http://code.google.com/events/io/2009/sessions/EvenFasterWebsites.html">2009 Google I/O session &#8211; Even Faster Websites</a>.  It&#8217;s worth the time to see what his research has turned up on how browsers work.</p>
