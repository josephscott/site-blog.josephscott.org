										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Recently Sarah had some old Knitters magazines out on the table.  This one caught my eye, as it looked rather dated:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-sq-EhpPzCz0/UFtyT0cTa5I/AAAAAAAAAeI/aA_gJqIN7-0/IMAGE_DDCC513D-7469-4713-BCB6-7640A5E32422.JPG" title="Knitters 1996" class="alignnone" width="384" height="512" /></p>
<p>Turns out it was from 1996:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-bAIWQeglNMM/UFtyaweTUPI/AAAAAAAAAdI/BZX3tIpJgLU/s720/IMAGE_F628F888-4B8B-4156-9117-46493CDC20A5.JPG" title="Knitters 1996" class="alignnone" width="720" height="540" /></p>
<p>The back cover drove home how long ago 1996 really was:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-jLuKxtlLRoI/UFtyu-YFrrI/AAAAAAAAAeQ/qQmoVWjHYcA/s512/IMAGE_3BA200FC-7642-45C5-A28B-ACE8D4F78651.JPG" title="Netscape 1996" class="alignnone" width="384" height="512" /></p>
<p>Now that threw me into flashback mode.  Netscape in 1996 on a Mac!  I took a few close up photos:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-R20ICdSvee0/UFtywfedLHI/AAAAAAAAAdg/TPuFDe383R4/s720/IMAGE_5AE3CAED-7C77-4A97-A32A-EC854063D25A.JPG" title="Netscape 1996 close up 1" class="alignnone" width="720" height="540" /></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-QYP284nh-mY/UFtyxwnbSBI/AAAAAAAAAdo/xc2oqKMe1p8/s720/IMAGE_F5DD6B95-C79D-4B26-813D-8D3516DBDB8F.JPG" title="Netscape 1996 close up 2" class="alignnone" width="720" height="540" /></p>
<p>Based on the date and the screenshot I believe that was Netscape 2.x.  In 1996 I used Netscape, but I didn&#8217;t have a Mac, I was using both Windows and FreeBSD on my desktop systems.  But I did do tech support for people who were running Netscape on Mac back then.</p>
<p>When I saw those magazines on the table I didn&#8217;t expect to be re-living web browser history from 15 plus years ago.  Makes me wonder if a screen shot of Chrome 22 on Mac OS 10.8 will invoke the same sort of nostalgia in 2027.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>By now most folks have heard about the <a href="http://www.calacanis.com/2006/07/18/everyones-gotta-eat-or-1-000-a-month-for-doing-what-youre/">Jason Calacanis $1,000/month social bookmark/news</a> offer.  I&#8217;m sure some will be upset, others will be thrilled to see more money being injected into this area of the web.  Lets not worry about sides right now, I&#8217;m interested in what these numbers actually represent.  Bring on the basic math!</p>
<p>Jason provided some ball park numbers in his <a href="http://www.calacanis.com/2006/07/19/wow-what-a-response-or-why-people-get-upset-when-you-offer/">follow up post on the response to his offer</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>12 social bookmarkers</li>
<li>$1,000 per month ($12,000 per year)</li>
<li>Estimated 2-3 hours per day</li>
<li>At least 150 stories per month per person</li>
</ul>
<p>So for $144,000 per year Jason expects to get at least 21,600 stories.  So the big picture is that the maximum cost for his offer is approximately $6.67 per story link.  If his social employers do more than the minimum of 150 stories then his costs per story goes done, so his per story link cost is probably going to be less than $6.67.  These numbers are even more interesting in the light of Jason&#8217;s most recent post, <a href="http://www.calacanis.com/2006/07/19/nicholas-carr-nails-it/">Nicholas Carr nails it</a>, because he estimates the value of each story link at $7 to $12.  I don&#8217;t know the details of what other costs Jason has to pay for to keep the new <a href="http://www.netscape.com/">Netscape.com</a> up, but one thing seems clear, he won&#8217;t be loosing money by paying people for story links.</p>
<p>Now for the other end of these numbers, what the &#8220;<a href="http://www.calacanis.com/2006/07/18/everyones-gotta-eat-or-1-000-a-month-for-doing-what-youre/">Netscape Navigators</a>&#8221; get out of this.  To make things easier we&#8217;ll assume that they will be working regular business days, 23 per month.  To meet the 150 links per month they will have to submit about 7 per day.  Using the 2-3 hours per day that Jason mentioned each link is allotted 17 to 25 minutes.  Not a completely unreasonable time frame I think.  At 46 to 69 hours per month (23 x 2 and 23 x 3) the hourly rate is $21 to $14 per hour for each &#8220;Navigator&#8221;.</p>
<p>So is it worth it?  We&#8217;ll obviously $12,000 per year isn&#8217;t exactly a full time job, but as extra money it isn&#8217;t bad.  I think for most people the deciding factor would be time.</p>
