So the big picture is that the maximum cost for his offer is approximately $6.67 per story link.  If his social employers do more than the minimum of 150 stories then his costs per story goes done, so his per story link cost is probably going to be less than $6.67.  These numbers are even more interesting in the light of Jason&#8217;s most recent post, <a href=\"http://www.calacanis.com/2006/07/19/nicholas-carr-nails-it/\">Nicholas Carr nails it</a>, because he estimates the value of each story link at $7 to $12.  I don&#8217;t know the details of what other costs Jason has to pay for to keep the new <a href=\"http://www.netscape.com/\">Netscape.com</a> up, but one thing seems clear, he won&#8217;t be loosing money by paying people for story links.</p>\n<p>Now for the other end of these numbers, what the &#8220;<a href=\"http://www.calacanis.com/2006/07/18/everyones-gotta-eat-or-1-000-a-month-for-doing-what-youre/\">Netscape Navigators</a>&#8221; get out of this.  To make things easier we&#8217;ll assume that they will be working regular business days, 23 per month.  To meet the 150 links per month they will have to submit about 7 per day.  Using the 2-3 hours per day that Jason mentioned each link is allotted 17 to 25 minutes.  Not a completely unreasonable time frame I think.
