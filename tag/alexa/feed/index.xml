										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Just for kicks I was checking out the <a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details/joseph.randomnetworks.com">Alexa traffic stats for joseph.randomnetworks.com</a>.  They let you compare your stats against other sites, so I started looking at how my stats compared to a few others.  Most of them easily eclipsed my numbers.  Then I compared it to <a href="http://ma.tt/">ma.tt</a>:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/josephscott/2852911217/" title="Alexa Traffic by josephscott, on Flickr"><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3158/2852911217_5ea5e25952.jpg" width="444" height="500" alt="Alexa Traffic" /></a></p>
<p>I&#8217;d always had a healthy level of skepticism about how accurate Alexa was.  Once I saw this graph any hope of usefulness that Alexa may have had  was completely gone.  I know for a certainty that not only does  ma.tt get more traffic that this site does, it gets a ton more traffic that I do.</p>
<p>The level of disinformation that Alexa is providing has gone from being just useless to actively harmful.  So remember, friends don&#8217;t let friends rely on Alexa traffic statistics.  For anything.</p>
