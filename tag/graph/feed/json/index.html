This came up in a conversation again recently and I started thinking about the percentage change in the federal debt for each year.  I looked at the period from 1958 to 2012, what I would call the modern era of federal debt.</p>\n<p>I went back to the <a href=\"http://www.treasurydirect.gov/govt/reports/pd/histdebt/histdebt.htm\">federal debt records</a>, they go from 1790 to today.  Dumped that data into a spreadsheet, then calculated the percentage change for each year from 1958 &#8211; 2012.  I used the all actual numbers, I didn&#8217;t attempt to normalize them to 2012 dollars since each year is just a comparison of the year before.</p>\n<p>Copying that into Google Charts Javascript code generates this graph:</p>\n<p><strong>Percentage Change in Federal Debt, 1958-2012</strong><br />\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"//www.google.com/jsapi\"></script><br />\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\ngoogle.load('visualization', '1', {packages: ['corechart']});\n</script><br />\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\nfunction drawVisualization() {\n// Create and populate the data table.\nvar data = google.visualization.arrayToDataTable([\n['Year', '% Change'],\n['1958-06-30',  2.15],\n['1959-06-30',  3.03],\n['1960-06-30',  0.57],\n['1961-06-30',  0.92],\n['1962-06-30',  3.19],\n['1963-06-30',  2.57],\n['1964-06-30',  1.91],\n['1965-06-30',  1.78],\n['1966-06-30',  0.83],\n['1967-06-30',  1.97],\n['1968-06-30',  6.55],\n['1969-06-30',  1.77],\n['1970-06-30',  4.86],\n['1971-06-30',  7.34],\n['1972-06-30',  7.32],\n['1973-06-30',  7.23],\n['1974-06-30',  3.69],\n['1975-06-30',  12.24],\n['1976-06-30',  16.36],\n['1977-09-30',  12.64],\n['1978-09-30',  10.40],\n['1979-09-30',  7.13],\n['1980-09-30',  9.82],\n['1981-09-30',  9.93],\n['1982-09-30',  14.45],\n['1983-09-30',  20.59],\n['1984-09-30',  14.16],\n['1985-09-30',  15.95],\n['1986-09-30',  16.58],\n['1987-09-30',  10.59],\n['1988-09-30',  10.72],\n['1989-09-29',  9.80],\n['1990-09-28',  13.15],\n['1991-09-30',  13.36],\n['1992-09-30',  10.89],\n['1993-09-30',  8.53],\n['1994-09-30',  6.38],\n['1995-09-29',  5.99],\n['1996-09-30',  5.04],\n['1997-09-30',  3.60],\n['1998-09-30',  2.09],\n['1999-09-30',  2.35],\n['2000-09-30',  0.32],\n['2001-09-30',  2.35],\n['2002-09-30',  7.25],\n['2003-09-30',  8.91],\n['2004-09-30',  8.78],\n['2005-09-30',  7.50],\n['2006-09-30',  7.24],\n['2007-09-30',  5.89],\n['2008-09-30',  11.29],\n['2009-09-30',  18.80],\n['2010-09-30',  13.87],\n['2011-09-30',  9.06],\n['2012-09-30',  8.63]\n]);      \n// Create and draw the visualization.\nnew google.visualization.LineChart(document.getElementById('visualization')).draw(data, { width: 750, height: 400 } );\n}\ngoogle.setOnLoadCallback(drawVisualization);\n</script></p>\n<div id=\"visualization\" style=\"width: 500px; height: 400px; margin-left: -100px; margin-top: -75px;\"></div>\n<p>You can mouse over each point to see the exact value for any given year.</p>\n<p>A few observations on this graph.
