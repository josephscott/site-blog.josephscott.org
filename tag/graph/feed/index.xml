										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve previously mentioned that the <a href="http://josephscott.org/archives/2009/04/history-of-the-federal-debt/">last time the US federal debt went down instead of up was 1957</a>.  This came up in a conversation again recently and I started thinking about the percentage change in the federal debt for each year.  I looked at the period from 1958 to 2012, what I would call the modern era of federal debt.</p>
<p>I went back to the <a href="http://www.treasurydirect.gov/govt/reports/pd/histdebt/histdebt.htm">federal debt records</a>, they go from 1790 to today.  Dumped that data into a spreadsheet, then calculated the percentage change for each year from 1958 &#8211; 2012.  I used the all actual numbers, I didn&#8217;t attempt to normalize them to 2012 dollars since each year is just a comparison of the year before.</p>
<p>Copying that into Google Charts Javascript code generates this graph:</p>

<p>You can mouse over each point to see the exact value for any given year.</p>
<p>A few observations on this graph.  First, these are all increases, no negative numbers.  Next, you&#8217;ll easily notice that the year with the largest percentage increase was 1983, at 20.5%.  The next highest increase was 2009, at 18.8%.</p>
<p>The highs weren&#8217;t what most surprised me in this data, it was the lows.  In 2000 the percentage increase in federal debt from 1999 was only 0.32%.  That is the smallest percentage increase since 1957.  I knew that we&#8217;d reduced the yearly budget deficits during that period, but I had no idea how close we were to actually reducing the total federal debt.</p>
<p>For 2000 the dollar increase of the federal debt was $17,907,308,271.43, or roughly $18 billion ( yes, billion with a b ).  That sounds like a significant amount, but compared to other years is very small.  To give you some idea of how small, in 2001 the percentage increase was 2.35%, the dollar amount was $133,285,202,313.20, more than 7 times the amount in 2000.</p>
<p>I wanted to know more about what it would have taken to actually reduce the total debt in 2000.  The <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BUDGET-2000-BUD/html/BUDGET-2000-BUD-9.htm">2000 budget request</a> expenditures were listed as $1,765 billion.  To keep things simple I&#8217;m looking at this from the point of view of how much in spending cuts we would have needed in the 2000 budget to clear $18 billion that could have been used to reduce the total federal debt.</p>
<p>A little bit of math shows that $18 billion was 1.02% of the $1,765 billion in spending listed in the <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BUDGET-2000-BUD/html/BUDGET-2000-BUD-9.htm">proposed 2000 federal budget</a>.</p>
<p>Lets say we could find 1.1% in reductions in the budget to go towards paying down the debt.  That would get us $19.4 billion.  The first $18 billion would go to cover the increase that happened in the debt, leaving a $1.4 billion reduction in the total federal debt.  That is only a tiny fraction of the $5,674 billion total debt in 2000, but it would have been the first time in more than 40 years that it went down instead of up.</p>
<p>All totally hypothetical and vastly over simplified, but this gave me a much clearer picture of the history of the federal debt.</p>
