I&#8217;ve been on the edge of giving up too, but I&#8217;m still hoping that they&#8217;ll be able to turn things around.

It is great and all for <a href=\"http://www.newsweek.com/\">Newsweek</a> to be bringing in <a href=\"http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/7681901/site/newsweek/\">blog commentary on the articles</a>, this is a big step for them.  But I was ticked that Technorati, who can&#8217;t even get their site to work half of the time, is expanding their services to others instead of making the darn thing work in the first place.</p>\n<p>Then it hit me, perhaps Technorati is getting a boat load of money to provide this service to Newsweek.  I mean a lot of money, in multiple shipping containers.  Hopefully this is the case, because they need some way to make their site work and I&#8217;m hoping that a metric ton of money will make that possible.

I&#8217;m hoping that someone with that much passion for their business will find some way to make things better.</p>\n",
