										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Two years ago I mentioned <a href="https://josephscott.org/archives/2011/09/solo/">Solo</a>, which uses TCP/IP port binding to prevent a program from running more than once.</p>
<p>For those that don&#8217;t want to use up ports or would rather stick to file locks for other reasons you can accomplish the same thing with <a href='http://www.unixwiz.net/tools/lockrun.html'>lockrun</a>.</p>
<p>An example cron entry using lockrun:</p>
<blockquote><p>
*/5 * * * * /usr/local/bin/lockrun &#8211;lockfile=/var/run/cacti.lockrun &#8212; /usr/local/bin/cron-cacti-poller</p>
<p>IMPORTANT: Be sure to place the lockfile in a directory that only that user has the rights to, and not in /tmp (as this Tech Tip has previously suggested). If a different user has the ability to write to the directory, s/he could create a symbolic link from the target lockfile to some system file that uses locks the same way, and get the cron job to foul up the locking.<br />
The file used, /var/run/cacti.lockrun, is created (if necessary), the lock acquired, and closed when finished. At no time does lockrun perform any file I/O: the file exists only to be the subject of locking requests.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Overall I like the Solo approach better, but it might not be a good option in every situation. In those cases lockrun looks like a good alternative.</p>
