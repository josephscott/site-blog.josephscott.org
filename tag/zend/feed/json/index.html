On top of that, <a href=\"http://www.php.net/\">PHP</a> (which is what Zend works on) is probably the most commonly used language to access MySQL databases.

Perhaps the closest thing to an Apache company would be <a href=\"http://www.covalent.net/\">Covalent</a>.  Going down the stack leads us to <a href=\"http://www.redhat.com/\">Red Hat</a> as the next likely target.  Not only would this get them an operating system (OS) of their own, they would get all of the other companies and technologies that Red Hat has acquired over the years.</p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t know if either of these companies (Covalent and Red Hat) would be willing to sell to Oracle, but if Oracle could pull that off they&#8217;d have everything (assuming they also pick up JBoss, Zend and Sleepycat) to offer a real physical database server.  I&#8217;m imagining something along the lines of the <a href=\"http://www.google.com/enterprise/gsa/\">Google Search Appliance</a> (GSA).
