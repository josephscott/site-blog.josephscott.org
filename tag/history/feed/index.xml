If Topaz doesn&#8217;t sound familiar, you might know it by another term.  It was a <a href="https://www.history.com/topics/world-war-ii/japanese-american-relocation">Japanese internment camp</a>.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/history-maya.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/history-maya-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="840" height="630" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-16680" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/history-maya-1024x768.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/06/history-maya-300x225.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/06/history-maya-768x576.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/06/history-maya-1200x900.jpg 1200w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/06/history-maya.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 840px) 100vw, 840px" /></a></p>
<p>This is something we&#8217;ve talked about doing for awhile, and now that some of the kids are a little older, it felt like the right time.  It is important that the next generation have something tangible to remember about the era of Japanese internment in the United States.  I was able to hear first hand accounts from people I&#8217;ve known who were in the internment camps in their youth.  As time goes on, that is going to happen less and less.</p>
<p>The location of the camp itself is mostly empty desert now.  One square mile of open land, with very little to see.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/topaz-empty.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/topaz-empty-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="840" height="630" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-16682" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/topaz-empty-1024x768.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/06/topaz-empty-300x225.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/06/topaz-empty-768x576.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/06/topaz-empty-1200x900.jpg 1200w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/06/topaz-empty.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 840px) 100vw, 840px" /></a></p>
<p>In one corner of the old camp there are three markers and an American flag.  The location is now a U.S. National Historic Landmark.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.topazmuseum.org/">Topaz museum</a> is in the small town of Delta, and it is a must visit if you are down there.  It has a wonderful setup.  Among the many items in the museum is the camera that Dave Tatsuno used to document a few aspects of life in the Topaz camp.</p>

<p>Because of the historical significance of the film it is now part of the Library of Congress.  You can also find it on Youtube.</p>
<a href="/2018/06/05/topaz-war-relocation-center/"><img src="/wp-content/plugins/wp-youtube-lyte/lyteCache.php?origThumbUrl=%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FKboirnCzius%2Fhqdefault.jpg" alt="YouTube Video"></a><br /><br /></p>
<p>You will see many smiling faces, Tatsuno indicated that people were trying to put on a happy face to hide the pain and sorrow.</p>
<p>Topaz really does feel like the middle of no where.  It is a vast empty space, with a strong wind that makes it difficult to hear a person next to you speaking.  I can&#8217;t imagine be forced to live there, under armed guard ( one person was shot and killed for getting too close to the fence ), for three years.</p>
<p>The first step in learning from history is to remember it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>No matter how good your memory is, there are times when you just can&#8217;t recall when something happened.  I was thinking about a few events in my life and realized I couldn&#8217;t always pin down when they were.</p>
<p>Some times there are significant world events that help solidify when something happened.  One example of this is when I went to <a href="http://www.defcon.org/html/defcon-4/defcon-4.html">DEF CONF IV</a>.  I&#8217;ll always remember that was in the summer of 1996 because I remember seeing the news about the <a href="http://www.cnn.com/US/9607/27/olympic.bomb.main/">Olympic Park bombing in Atlanta</a> while I was there.</p>
<p>I started to wonder if I could use this technique on some of my more fuzzy memories.  So I tried to remember when I first started using Google as my primary means for searching the web.  I started my current job on 1 May 1999, but couldn&#8217;t remember if I&#8217;d been using Google at my old job, or my current one.  One item I could remember that was after I started using Google was <a href="http://www.google.com/press/pressrel/pressrelease48.html">Google&#8217;s purchase of Deja.com&#8217;s Usenet archive</a>, which was on 12 February 2001.  So likely before 2001, and maybe after May 1999.  Not perfect, but it is better than the fuzzy void that comes up when I request the memory from my brain.</p>
<p><b>&lt;Side Note&gt;</b> How&#8217;s this PR title strike you: <a href="http://www.google.com/press/pressrel/pressrelease25.html">Yahoo! Selects Google as its Default Search Engine Provider</a>.  Amazing what a difference six years will make.  I didn&#8217;t realize how entertaining looking at old press releases could be.<b>&lt;/Side Note&gt;</b></p>
<p>How&#8217;s this for an old memory, I was able to track down roughly when I started reading <a href="http://jeremy.zawodny.com/blog/">JeremY!&#8217;s Blog</a> because I remember that while I was searching for something about MySQL I ended up on a post about <a href="http://jeremy.zawodny.com/blog/archives/000310.html">tooth repair</a>.  This puts my timeline around November 2002.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m starting to wonder if I can do this on purpose.  Are there strong (or odd) events that I can link with new memories that I&#8217;m currently making?  Certainly &#8220;bloging&#8221; about a thing or event helps because I can usually at least remember, oh yeah, I blogged that somewhere.  To a lesser degree the same things holds true for <a href="http://del.icio.us/josephscott">my del.icio.us</a> bookmarks.</p>
<p>How&#8217;s this for an easy thing to remember, my first daughter (Alice) was born on my 6th wedding anniversary (3 Jan 2002).  If only every important date was that easy to remember.</p>
