										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://www.fec.gov/">Federal Election Committee</a> ( FEC ) published the <a href="https://transition.fec.gov/general/FederalElections2016.shtml">Election Results for the U.S. President, the U.S. Senate and the U.S. House of Representatives for 2016</a> last month.  You can get the report in <a href="https://transition.fec.gov/pubrec/fe2016/federalelections2016.pdf">PDF</a> and <a href="https://transition.fec.gov/pubrec/fe2016/federalelections2016.xlsx">Excel</a> formats.</p>
<p>From page 5 of the PDF, here are all of the candidates who received at least one million votes:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Candidate</th>
<th>Votes</th>
<th>Percentage of Total Votes</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Hillary Clinton</td>
<td>65,853,514</td>
<td>48.18%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Donald J. Trump</td>
<td>62,984,828</td>
<td>46.09%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Gary Johnson</td>
<td>4,489,221</td>
<td>3.28%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Jill Stein</td>
<td>1,457,218</td>
<td>1.07%</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>It turns out that is also the list of all the candidates who received 1% or more of the votes.</p>
<p>The candidate with the fewest votes was Frank Atwood, with 337.  There were 136,669,235 votes in total.</p>
<p>Hillary Clinton received 2,868,686 more votes than Donald Trump.  Or 4.55% ( 2,868,686 / 62,984,828 ), when looking at the relative difference.  And because that doesn&#39;t determine who is elected President, here is a link about the <a href="https://www.archives.gov/federal-register/electoral-college/about.html">Electoral College</a>.</p>
<p>That has been covered in detail by others.  What I am trying to figure out now is why it takes the Federal Election Committee 13 months to publish the results.</p>
