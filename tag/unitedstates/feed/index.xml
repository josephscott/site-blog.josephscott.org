IN CONGRESS, July 4, 1776.</p>
<p>The unanimous Declaration of the thirteen united States of America,</p>
<p>When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature&#8217;s God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.

<p>From <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/map_of_the_week/2012/07/map_of_soda_consumption_americans_drink_more_than_anyone_else_.html">Americans Drink More Soda Than Anyone Else</a> ( via <a href="http://what-if.xkcd.com/74/">Soda Planet</a> )</p>
<p>That would be nearly half a liter per day for every person in America on average.  </p>
<p>As I&#8217;ve gotten older my soda consumption has dropped significantly.  I can count on my fingers the number of times I have a soda in a year.  On the flip side, I drink lots of water.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Through an odd series of questions about U.S. states at work the idea came up about states having songs, the same way that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Star_Spangled_Banner">The Star-Spangled Banner</a> is the U.S. national anthem.  One of my co-workers mentioned that there were, so I did a little research.  According to <a href="http://www.50states.com/">50states.com</a> we do indeed have state songs.  The state song of <a href="http://www.50states.com/californ.htm">California</a> is <a href="http://www.50states.com/songs/calif.htm">I Love You California</a>.</p>
<p>I learned something new today.</p>
