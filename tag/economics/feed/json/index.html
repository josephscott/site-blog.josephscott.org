            "content_html": "<p>Utah, like so many other states, is trying to adapt their state budget to the current economic conditions.  In general this translates into budget shortfalls, often resulting in spending cuts and tax increases.  I recently received a flyer from Senator Wayne Niederhauser that included a survey about political priorities. Question two was:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\nThis past year, Utah was named the &#8220;Best Managed State&#8221; by the Pew Center in <em>Governing Magazine</em>.  This recognition is a result of Utah&#8217;s proactive fiscal management and AAA bond rating (the highest rating given to States) and having over $400 million in Rainy Day Funds, a credit to Republican leadership in Utah.  In light of declining tax revenues, please list your priorities for funding from 1 to 10, with 1 being the highest priority.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>That as followed by a list of options to prioritize.  The part that struck me was the $400 million plus in rainy day funds.  I was pretty impressed, a state that actually set aside money when times were good to be used when times were bad.  Many folks are now calling for these rainy day funds to be used to offset the shortfalls in the current budget.  From what I&#8217;ve been reading in the <a href=\"http://www.deseretnews.com/home/\">Deseret News</a> (one of the major Salt Lake City newspapers, <a href=\"http://www.sltrib.com/\">Salt Lake Tribune</a> being the other) politicians don&#8217;t seem to be very eager to make use of these rainy day funds right now.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve been wondering why that is.  Maybe they are worried that they might need that money if things continue to go down hill, the idea being that the rainy day fund is a fix of last resort.  I don&#8217;t know, but I wanted to find out a bit more about what the Utah state budget looks like.  The <a href=\"http://governor.utah.gov/gopb/\">Governor&#8217;s Office of Planning and Budget (GOPB)</a> has a budget summary PDF that looked like a good place to start.  For fiscal year 2010 the budget summary page (page 9 of 177 in the PDF) indicated that the total recommended budget for 2010 is $10.6 billion.  Utah has less than 3 million people, so the size of the state budget is relatively modest when compared with other states.</p>\n<figure style=\"width: 500px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Utah Rainy Day Fund - From 2010 Budget Summary\" src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3444/3304764597_88178d8de9.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"376\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Utah Rainy Day Fund - From 2010 Budget Summary</figcaption></figure>\n<p>There is a chart on page 14 of the PDF showing the historic balances of the rainy day fund.  It peaked at $414 million and indicates the governor is requesting that some of that money be used to shore up the 2009 and 2010 budgets.  When looking at the $10.6 billion and $414 million next to each other I realized that the rainy day fund is really only a small percentage of the annual state budget.  How small you ask?  3.9 percent.  I was disappointed when I saw that number, the way the rainy day fund is talked up I&#8217;d hoped for something a bit more.</p>\n<p>With an annual budget of $10.6 billion the rainy day fund has enough money in it to run the state for 14.3 days.  With the rainy day fund shrinking the reality is it wouldn&#8217;t even last that long.
