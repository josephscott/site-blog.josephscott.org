										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>James Hamilton on <a href="http://perspectives.mvdirona.com/2013/11/datacenter-renewable-power-done-right/">Datacenter Renewable Power Done Right</a> ( back in 2013 ):</p>
<blockquote><p>
how can running a low-scale power plant on a fossil fuel possibly be green and is on-site generation really going to be the most environmentally conscious means of powering data centers? Most datacenters lack space for large on-site generation facilities, most datacenter operators donâ€™t have the skill, and generally the most efficient power generation plants are far bigger than a single datacenter could ever consume on its worst day.
</p></blockquote>
<p>His key point about on-site power generation at datacenters:</p>
<blockquote><p>
I still find myself skeptical that the world leaders in operating efficient and reliable power plans are going to be datacenter operators.
</p></blockquote>
<p>This may be a legitimate concern.  Then again, fifteen years ago I wouldn&#8217;t have guessed that Amazon would come to define pay as you go servers and services ( &#8220;the cloud&#8221; ).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When <a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/">Google App Engine</a> was announced one of the features that was heavily pushed was it&#8217;s ability to scale.  Combined with Amazon&#8217;s AWS products, I&#8217;ve been thinking about other companies who could/should be in the cloud services business.  There&#8217;s the obvious ones that everyone talks about like Microsoft and Yahoo, but then another name came to mind: <a href="http://www.sun.com/">Sun</a>.</p>
<p>What service should Sun offer to the world?  I&#8217;ll give you a hint, they recently spent $1 billion dollars <a href="http://joseph.randomnetworks.com/archives/2008/01/16/sun-buys-mysql/">acquiring the company</a> behind the product.  Yep, none other than <a href="http://mysql.com/">MySQL</a>.</p>
<p>Love it or hate it, MySQL is widely used by many companies and individuals.  What I&#8217;d like to see from Sun is a MySQL cloud service that works just like your current MySQL server(s), only better.  It should scale such that I don&#8217;t have to worry about performance and replicate data sufficiently that I&#8217;ll always have access to my data.  There&#8217;s no need for a new API, since MySQL already supports network connectivity.</p>
<p>With MySQL already in such wide spread use, the benefits would be easy to see.  For instance, I could use such a service to power my WordPress blog with only a few changes to my wp-config.php file.  Effectively requiring zero code changes.</p>
<p>Pricing wise I&#8217;d expect something similar to EC2 or S3, a general pay as you go schedule.  Perhaps even with a very low use free option, just enough for people to get hooked.  But if I were <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/jonathan/">Jonathan Schwartz</a> I wouldn&#8217;t stop there.</p>
<p>As nice as it is to have an easy to use pay as you go web service, there are many companies that would like the performance, scalability and reliability of such a service but don&#8217;t want to send all their data to Sun.  Enter Sun&#8217;s <a href="http://www.sun.com/products/sunmd/s20/">Modular Datacenter</a>, a.k.a. data center in a box.  Okay, a very big box, but a box none the less.  Take all the lessons they learn making the MySQL cloud service work and put them in the data center box and sell it.</p>
<p>This would also appeal to hosting companies, who could then offer the same sort of service to the users.  Imagine some place like <a href="http://www.theplanet.com/">The Planet</a> having a few of these in their data centers.  They&#8217;d get the benefits of the cloud service without having to haul all that traffic over their Internet connections.</p>
<p>In my ideal world this wouldn&#8217;t be limited to MySQL.  I&#8217;d love to see this same sort of thing for <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a>, since Sun has also been pushing <a href="http://www.sun.com/software/products/postgresql/index.jsp">PostgreSQL for Solaris</a> as well.  Sadly I&#8217;m not holding my breath on that one.  With PostgreSQL being a much more community based project, there&#8217;s nothing to stop some other company from providing this service.</p>
<p>Perhaps Sun should have <a href="http://joseph.randomnetworks.com/archives/2007/08/23/from-sunw-to-java/">changed their stock ticker</a> to MYSQ instead of JAVA.</p>
