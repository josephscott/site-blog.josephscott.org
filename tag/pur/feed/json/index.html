A URL can be mapped to either a function or a method of a class.

Everything else goes through the DEMO class.</p>\n<p>Another thing to note, because of the way the URL patterns are tested, the more specific URLs must appear higher up.  That&#8217;s why color/black shows up before color.  If there was a color/black/blue then it would have to be listed about color/black.  The home page is a little bit of a special case, it&#8217;s the empty URL value.</p>\n<p>It doesn&#8217;t matter where the code for the functions or classes are, it&#8217;s up to you to make sure they are pulled in before the routing takes place.
