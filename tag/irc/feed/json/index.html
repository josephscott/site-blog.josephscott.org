So I started with writing a simple library to speak to IRC servers.

I was writing this bot in <a href=\"http://php.net/\">PHP</a>, in part because I wanted to play with a few new language feature, specifically &#8211; <a href=\"http://www.php.net/manual/en/functions.anonymous.php\">anonymous functions</a>.

It&#8217;s been fun hooking up bot commands to various features and servers, you can see the list of currently support commands at <a href=\"http://raifbot.wordpress.com/\">http://raifbot.wordpress.com/</a>.  Many of the popular commands are just fun little diversions: <a href=\"http://raifbot.wordpress.com/commands-lart/\">$lart</a>, <a href=\"http://raifbot.wordpress.com/commands-8ball/\">$8ball</a>, <a href=\"http://raifbot.wordpress.com/commands-chuck-fact/\">$chuck-fact</a>.  Others reach out to online services to provide info, like <a href=\"http://raifbot.wordpress.com/commands-weather/\">$weather</a>.</p>\n<p>Now back to the idea of using anonymous functions.  All of the command functions in raifbot have this style:</p>\n<p>[sourcecode lang=&#8221;php&#8221;]<br />\n$_commands[&#8216;rot13&#8217;] = function ( $channel, $nick, $msg ) {<br />\n    global $bot;</p>\n<p>    if ( empty( $msg ) ) {<br />\n        return;<br />\n    }</p>\n<p>    $reply = &quot;{$nick} &#8211; rot13( &#8216;{$msg}&#8217; ) : &quot; . str_rot13( $msg );<br />\n    $bot-&gt;send_message( $channel, $reply );<br />\n};<br />\n[/sourcecode]</p>\n<p>Each command function definition is just an entry in the global <code>$_commands</code> array.</p>\n<p>I used this approach because I had a particular feature in mind, the ability to add new commands and update existing ones without having to restart the bot process.  In the end I choose anonymous functions to accomplish this, which allowed me to avoid <code>eval</code> and other odd language hacks.</p>\n<p>When I send a <code>HUP</code> signal to the bot process that triggers a reload of all the command files.  At that point updating a command function definition is just a matter of updating an entry in an array.  No errors and no fuss.  I add new commands and update existing ones without having to ever take down the bot process.  So far this has worked very well.</p>\n<p>If you want to interact with raifbot join the #uphpu channel on freenode and give a spin.  Remember all of the commands start with $ and the list of supported commands is <a href=\"http://raifbot.wordpress.com/\">http://raifbot.wordpress.com/</a>.</p>\n<p>In addition to raifbot I&#8217;ve started a few other experimental projects.
