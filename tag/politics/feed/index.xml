										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You have likely heard of &#8220;The Golden Rule&#8221;, which is usually described as: treat other people the way that you want to be treated.  The New Testament version comes from <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/matt/7?lang=eng">Matthew 7:12</a> ( emphasis mine ):</p>
<blockquote><p>
12 <strong>Therefore all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them</strong>: for this is the law and the prophets.
</p></blockquote>
<p>While talking with others about the current political situation I thought of a version of this that could be applied specifically to politics:</p>
<blockquote><p>
<strong>Govern in the way that you would want an opposing party to govern.</strong>
</p></blockquote>
<p>That is to say that while your policies and agenda may be different, the way you go about it should be completely above board and beyond reproach.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today a mob of Donald Trump supporters, and the Republican Party, attacked and invaded the United States Capitol building.  My heart is low as a I try to process what has happened.  For now, I will borrow the words of others who have attempted to describe this disgrace we have brought upon ourselves.</p>
<h3>James Matis</h3>
<blockquote><p>
Today’s violent assault on our Capitol, an effort to subjugate American democracy by mob rule, was fomented by Mr. Trump.  His use of the Presidency to destroy trust in our election and to poison our respect for fellow citizens has been enabled by pseudo political leaders whose names will live in infamy as profiles in cowardice.  Our Constitution and our Republic will overcome this stain and We the People will come together again in our never-ending effort to form a more perfect Union, while Mr. Trump will deservedly be left a man without a country.</p>
<p><cite><a href="https://twitter.com/evansiegfried/status/1346981168059715584">https://twitter.com/evansiegfried/status/1346981168059715584</a></cite>
</p></blockquote>
<h3>Barack Obama</h3>
<blockquote><p>
History will rightly remember today’s violence at the Capitol, incited by a sitting president who has continued to baselessly lie about the outcome of a lawful election, as a moment of great dishonor and shame for our nation. But we’d be kidding ourselves if we treated it as a total surprise.</p>
<p>For two months now, a political party and its accompanying media ecosystem has too often been unwilling to tell their followers the truth — that this was not a particularly close election and that President-Elect Biden will be inaugurated on January 20. Their fantasy narrative has spiraled further and further from reality, and it builds upon years of sown resentments. Now we’re seeing the consequences, whipped up into a violent crescendo.</p>
<p>Right now, Republican leaders have a choice made clear in the desecrated chambers of democracy. They can continue down this road and keep stoking the raging fires. Or they can choose reality and take the first steps toward extinguishing the flames. They can choose America.</p>
<p>I’ve been heartened to see many members of the President’s party speak up forcefully today. Their voices add to the examples of Republican state and local election officials in states like Georgia who’ve refused to be intimidated and have discharged their duties honorably. We need more leaders like these — right now and in the days, weeks, and months ahead as President-Elect Biden works to restore a common purpose to our politics. It’s up to all of us as Americans, regardless of party, to support him in that goal.</p>
<p><cite><a href="https://dayton247now.com/news/local/former-us-president-obama-releases-statement-on-chaos-at-us-capitol">https://dayton247now.com/news/local/former-us-president-obama-releases-statement-on-chaos-at-us-capitol</a></cite>
</p></blockquote>
<h3>Mitt Romney</h3>
<blockquote><p>
We gather today due to a selfish man’s injured pride and the outrage of his supporters whom he has deliberately misinformed for the past two months and stirred to action this very morning. What happened here today was an insurrection, incited by the President of the United States. Those who choose to continue to support his dangerous gambit by objecting to the results of a legitimate, democratic election will forever be seen as being complicit in an unprecedented attack against our democracy. They will be remembered for their role in this shameful episode in American history. That will be their legacy.</p>
<p>The objectors have claimed they are doing so on behalf of the voters. Have an audit, they say, to satisfy the many people who believe that the election was stolen. Please! No Congressional led audit will ever convince those voters, particularly when the President will continue to claim that the election was stolen. The best way we can show respect for the voters who are upset is by telling them the truth. That is the burden, and the duty, of leadership. The truth is that President-elect Biden won this election. President Trump lost. Scores of courts, the President’s own Attorney General, and state election officials both Republican and Democrat have reached this unequivocal decision.</p>
<p>We must not be intimidated or prevented from fulfilling our constitutional duty. We must continue with the count of electoral college votes. In light of today’s sad circumstances, I ask my colleagues: Do we weigh our own political fortunes more heavily than we weigh the strength of our Republic, the strength of our democracy, and the cause of freedom? What is the weight of personal acclaim compared to the weight of conscience?</p>
<p>Leader McConnell said that the vote today is the most important in his 40 plus years of public service. That is not because this vote reveals something about the election; it is because this vote reveals something about ourselves. I urge my colleagues to move forward with completing the electoral count, to refrain from further objections, and to unanimously affirm the legitimacy of the presidential election.</p>

<blockquote><p>
This pattern — whereby political officials who are vehement supporters of the Surveillance State transform overnight into crusading privacy advocates once they learn that they themselves have been spied on — is one that has repeated itself over and over. It has been seen many times as part of the Snowden revelations, but also well before that.

<p>It is all fun and games until you discover the large surveillance state is targeting you too.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today I&#8217;m joining the time honored tradition of making predictions for the new year.  Translation: wild guesses and obvious statements.</p>
<h4>1. <a href="http://www.apple.com/">Apple</a> Makes A Move To Improve Internet Services</h4>
<p>Perhaps Apple&#8217;s single biggest weak spot has been online services.  It is clear they know how to do a good job making hardware, all the way down to the chip level in some cases, and software to run on that hardware.  Execution of large scale Internet services hasn&#8217;t gone as smoothly.</p>
<p>In the past people have suggested that Apple might buy an existing company to help bring in large scale web DNA.  I think what is more likely is that Apple makes a few key high level hires that build out new teams.</p>
<p>This won&#8217;t be an easy thing for Apple.  When I look around at more recent successful web startups I see lots of sharing.  That will be a significant change of pace for a company that invests heavily in secrecy.</p>
<p>I consider <a href="https://swift.org/">Swift</a> going open source a positive sign.</p>
<h4>2. <a href="http://www.lua.org/">Lua</a> Gets More Attention</h4>
<p>Cloudflare has been pushing the <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/pushing-nginx-to-its-limit-with-lua/">Nginx + Lua</a> combination for years now.  I consider that particular combination one of the most under rated technology stacks around.</p>
<p>If you were heavy into all the microservices talk during 2015 then Lua+Nginx is an exciting combination.  I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if AWS launches a new service around Lua.</p>
<p>I recommend <a href="https://openresty.org/">OpenResty</a> ( a build of Nginx with Lua ) and <a href="http://lua.space/">lua.space</a> ( community news ).</p>
<h4>3. Flash First Video Becomes Shameful</h4>
<p>We have pretty good support for the <a href="http://caniuse.com/#feat=video">video element</a>, it is time to move Flash for video to a <a href="http://docs.webplatform.org/wiki/html/elements/video#Flash_fallback">fallback</a> position.  You are probably already doing that for mobile devices, time to go all in.</p>
<h4>4. More Open Source From Microsoft</h4>
<p>Microsoft has started to gain back some geek cred with their push into making more of their code open source ( check out <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft">https://github.com/Microsoft</a> ).  My prediction is they go even further, announcing one of their larger key products will go open source.  The big bets would be Exchange or SQL Server.  The other big candidate would a component of Office.</p>
<h4>5. Strange U.S. Presidential Politics</h4>
<p>If you&#8217;d asked about this a year ago, I would have focused on how much I&#8217;m not keen on family dynasties for President.  At the time Jeb Bush and Hillary Clinton were safe bets on being the candidates from their respective parties.  One had a brother and father who were President, the other a husband.  Since then there have been dramatic changes on the Republican side, and very little change on the Democratic side.</p>
<p>My prediction: things get even stranger before the general election.  This might be the year for a <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/contested-convention-almost-everything-you-need-know-n478736">contested convention</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From <a href="http://www.marco.org/2013/10/10/treasury-chief-warns-of-severe-debt-limit-fallout">Marco Arment</a> replying to people suggesting he is writing too much about politics lately:</p>
<blockquote><p>
To those complaining that I’m posting about politics: I’d love for the U.S. political environment to return to a state where I can just do my job and ignore it.
</p></blockquote>
<p>The context of this particular post was the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/11/business/economy/treasury-secretary-warns-of-severe-debt-limit-fallout.html?hp&#038;_r=1&#038;">Treasury Chief Warns of Severe Debt-Limit Fallout</a> article at the New York Times.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;ll ever be able to &#8220;ignore&#8221; politics, but right now the political system is far too distracting.  What makes it worse is the cause of the distraction, paying our bills.  Initially deciding how to spend money should be deliberate and well thought out.  Paying our bills after we&#8217;ve spent the money?  That should be nearly automatic.</p>
<p>Can you imagine if it took me two weeks, 24 x 7, to decide if I was going to pay off my credit card each month?  I&#8217;d never get anything else done.</p>

<p>So is Mr. Matheson ready to repeal the fourth amendment?  Lets skip the peripheral issues and get right to the center of it.  Am I protected from search and seizure of my papers and effects or not?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: I have this backwards.</p>
<p>The three Utah Republicans voted to end the NSA spying on U.S. citizens.  My apologies to Rob Bishop, Jason Chaffetz, and Chris Stewart.  That leaves me frustrated with Jim Matheson.</p>
<p>I was completely wrong on the record of this vote and have written an <a href="https://josephscott.org/archives/2013/07/utah-democrat-jim-matheson-votes-to-continue-nsa-spying/">updated post</a>.</p>

The <a href="http://politics.nytimes.com/congress/votes/113/house/1/412">U.S. House of Representatives failed to limit NSA spying</a>.  In Utah three of the four representatives voted to continue NSA spying on U.S. citizens:</p>

<p>The three Republicans: <a href="http://robbishop.house.gov/">Rob Bishop</a>, <a href="http://chaffetz.house.gov/">Jason Chaffetz</a>, and <a href="http://stewart.house.gov/">Chris Stewart</a> voted for the NSA spying to continue.  The only Democrat, <a href="http://matheson.house.gov/">Jim Matheson</a>, voted to limit NSA spying on U.S. citizens.</p>
<p>My current representative is Jason Chaffetz.  It used to be Jim Matheson, but that changed after the 2010 redistricting of the Utah house seats.  I&#8217;ve already sent a complaint to Mr. Chaffetz about his vote on this matter.<br />
</strike></p>
<p>It dawned on me that what all those who voted to continue NSA spying on U.S. citizens should do is put forth a bill to repeal the fourth amendment to the U.S. Constitution.  If you are going to claim that you can search and seize my papers and effects at will, you may as well remove that protection from the Constitution entirely.</p>
