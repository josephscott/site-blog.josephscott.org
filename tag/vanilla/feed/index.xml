										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I installed <a href="http://getvanilla.com/">Vanilla</a> the other day to try it out.  I&#8217;m not excited about documentation that includes <code>chmod 777</code>.  I did that only long enough to finish the install and then tightened it up as soon as it was done.</p>
<p>The installation itself was simple enough.  Fill out a few forms and you are up and running.</p>
<p>One of the problems with forum software is that you never know how it is really going to perform until well after you have a community of users pumping topics and comments into it.  Of course by then it is a lot more work with switch if you run into problems.  Is there a standard for export/import of forums?  At least with blogs you have RSS/ATOM has a lowest common denominator for export/import.</p>
