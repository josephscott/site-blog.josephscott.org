										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>About two months I looked at adding <a href="http://gravatar.com/">Gravatars</a> to a page, where in most cases there would be 20 different Gravatars on each page view.  This seemed like a good time to try out Paul Hammond&#8217;s <a href="http://24ways.org/2010/speed-up-your-site-with-delayed-content">Speed Up Your Site with Delayed Content</a> technique for loading Gravatar images.  A few quick hacks later it was working and I was reasonably happy with it.</p>
<p>Fast forward a few more weeks and I found myself wanting to add Gravatars to another page, but this time most of the page views were going involving loading 250 different Gravatar images.  I went back to my original script for delayed loading, cleaned it up a bit and applied it to this new page.  At this point I realized that this was something that would be nice to have as a simple to use, mostly drop in feature.  So I refined it a bit more, made a few more improvements and I&#8217;m now making it public as <a href="http://josephscott.org/code/javascript/async-gravatars/">Async Gravatars</a>.  The code is open source and available on Github at <a href="https://github.com/josephscott/async-gravatars">https://github.com/josephscott/async-gravatars</a>.</p>
<p>The process and the code are actually very simple:</p>
<h3>Step 1</h3>
<p>Use the same SRC attribute for all of your Gravatar images in the IMG tag, with the md5 of the real Gravatar in the data-gravatar_hash attribute, like so:</p>
<p>[sourcecode lang=&#8221;html&#8221;]<br />
&lt;img data-gravatar_hash=&quot;713072bbe89035a79c17d19e53dd5d9b&quot;<br />
    class=&quot;load-gravatar&quot; height=&quot;64&quot; width=&quot;64&quot;<br />
    src=&quot;https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/00000000000000000000000000000000?s=64&amp;d=mm&quot; /&gt;<br />
[/sourcecode]</p>
<p>For PHP powered sites something like this will do the trick:</p>
<p>[sourcecode lang=&#8221;php&#8221;]<br />
&lt;img data-gravatar_hash=&quot;&lt;?php echo md5( strtolower( trim( $email ) ) ); ?&gt;&quot;<br />
    class=&quot;load-gravatar&quot; height=&quot;64&quot; width=&quot;64&quot;<br />
    src=&quot;https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/00000000000000000000000000000000?s=64&amp;d=mm&quot; /&gt;<br />
[/sourcecode]</p>
<p>It is important to use the same SRC for all of the images, that way your browser only needs to make on request for all of them.  And by using a real image with the same dimensions you won&#8217;t have issues with the page re-flowing when the real Gravatar gets loaded.  I should note that the one SRC value you use doesn&#8217;t have to be loaded from Gravatar.com, it can be something that you host on your own site.</p>
<h3>Step 2</h3>
<p>Load the <a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a> code and the <a href="https://github.com/josephscott/async-gravatars/blob/master/async-gravatars.js">async-gravatars.js</a> file, then one small piece of Javascript to trigger loading of the real Gravatar images after the page has finished loading:</p>
<p>[sourcecode lang=&#8221;javascript&#8221;]<br />
jQuery( document ).ready( function() {<br />
    $( &#8216;.load-gravatar&#8217; ).async_gravatars( {<br />
        ssl: true<br />
    } );<br />
} );<br />
[/sourcecode]</p>
<p>The <code>.async_gravatars()</code> function accepts the following options, with these defaults:</p>
<p>[sourcecode lang=&#8221;javascript&#8221;]<br />
{<br />
		&#8216;default_img&#8217;	: &#8216;identicon&#8217;,<br />
		&#8216;hash_attr&#8217;		: &#8216;data-gravatar_hash&#8217;,<br />
		&#8216;rating&#8217;		: &#8216;pg&#8217;,<br />
		&#8216;size&#8217;			: 64,<br />
		&#8216;ssl&#8217;			: false<br />
}<br />
[/sourcecode]</p>
<h3>Step 3</h3>
<p>Sit back and enjoy, there is no step 3!</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>If you want to see it in action I put together a little <a href="http://josephscott.org/code/javascript/async-gravatars/">demo page</a> that loads a sample of Gravatar images for some of my fellow <a href="http://automattic.com/">Automatticians</a>.  A <a href="https://github.com/josephscott/async-gravatars/blob/master/index.html">demo page</a> is also included in the Github project.</p>
<p>The Javascript code that does the work is <a href="https://github.com/josephscott/async-gravatars/blob/master/async-gravatars.js">very simple</a>, so spend a minute or two and take a look.  If you have suggestions or improvements let me know.</p>
