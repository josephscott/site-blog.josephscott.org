This seemed like a good time to try out Paul Hammond&#8217;s <a href=\"http://24ways.org/2010/speed-up-your-site-with-delayed-content\">Speed Up Your Site with Delayed Content</a> technique for loading Gravatar images.  A few quick hacks later it was working and I was reasonably happy with it.</p>\n<p>Fast forward a few more weeks and I found myself wanting to add Gravatars to another page, but this time most of the page views were going involving loading 250 different Gravatar images.  I went back to my original script for delayed loading, cleaned it up a bit and applied it to this new page.  At this point I realized that this was something that would be nice to have as a simple to use, mostly drop in feature.  So I refined it a bit more, made a few more improvements and I&#8217;m now making it public as <a href=\"http://josephscott.org/code/javascript/async-gravatars/\">Async Gravatars</a>.  The code is open source and available on Github at <a href=\"https://github.com/josephscott/async-gravatars\">https://github.com/josephscott/async-gravatars</a>.</p>\n<p>The process and the code are actually very simple:</p>\n<h3>Step 1</h3>\n<p>Use the same SRC attribute for all of your Gravatar images in the IMG tag, with the md5 of the real Gravatar in the data-gravatar_hash attribute, like so:</p>\n<p>[sourcecode lang=&#8221;html&#8221;]<br />\n&lt;img data-gravatar_hash=&quot;713072bbe89035a79c17d19e53dd5d9b&quot;<br />\n    class=&quot;load-gravatar&quot; height=&quot;64&quot; width=&quot;64&quot;<br />\n    src=&quot;https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/00000000000000000000000000000000?s=64&amp;d=mm&quot; /&gt;<br />\n[/sourcecode]</p>\n<p>For PHP powered sites something like this will do the trick:</p>\n<p>[sourcecode lang=&#8221;php&#8221;]<br />\n&lt;img data-gravatar_hash=&quot;&lt;?php echo md5( strtolower( trim( $email ) ) ); ?&gt;&quot;<br />\n    class=&quot;load-gravatar&quot; height=&quot;64&quot; width=&quot;64&quot;<br />\n    src=&quot;https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/00000000000000000000000000000000?s=64&amp;d=mm&quot; /&gt;<br />\n[/sourcecode]</p>\n<p>It is important to use the same SRC for all of the images, that way your browser only needs to make on request for all of them.
