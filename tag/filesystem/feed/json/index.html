I liked that there was an option to simply <a href=\"https://code.google.com/apis/console#access\">sign up for an API key</a>, allowing me to quickly try it out from the command line using cURL.  The JSON formatted results were easy enough to understand.</p>\n<p>That led to hooking up FUSE and Python to provide the ability to mount the <a href=\"http://developers.google.com/+/api/latest/people\">people.get data</a> as a filesystem.  A bit more hacking and <a href=\"https://github.com/josephscott/gplusfs\">gplusfs</a> was born.  It is still basic, but has been working fine so far with my profile.  This is all still read-only, since the Google+ API is read-only.</p>\n<p>Here is what a directory listing of my profile looks like:</p>\n<p>[sourcecode lang=&#8221;plain&#8221;]<br />\n&gt; ls -la *<br />\n-r&#8212;&#8212;&#8211; 1 root root   57 1970-01-01 00:00 aboutMe.txt<br />\n-r&#8212;&#8212;&#8211; 1 root root   12 1970-01-01 00:00 displayName.txt<br />\n-r&#8212;&#8212;&#8211; 1 root root    4 1970-01-01 00:00 gender.txt<br />\n-r&#8212;&#8212;&#8211; 1 root root   21 1970-01-01 00:00 id.txt<br />\n-r&#8212;&#8212;&#8211; 1 root root 5117 1970-01-01 00:00 image.jpg<br />\n-r&#8212;&#8212;&#8211; 1 root root   11 1970-01-01 00:00 kind.txt<br />\n-r&#8212;&#8212;&#8211; 1 root root   45 1970-01-01 00:00 url.txt</p>\n<p>organizations:<br />\ntotal 1<br />\ndr&#8212;&#8212;&#8211; 2 root root  0 1970-01-01 00:00 ./<br />\ndr&#8212;&#8212;&#8211; 2 root root  0 1970-01-01 00:00 ../<br />\n-r&#8212;&#8212;&#8211; 1 root root 10 1970-01-01 00:00 work.txt</p>\n<p>urls:<br />\ntotal 1<br />\ndr&#8212;&#8212;&#8211; 2 root root  0 1970-01-01 00:00 ./<br />\ndr&#8212;&#8212;&#8211; 2 root root  0 1970-01-01 00:00 ../<br />\n-r&#8212;&#8212;&#8211; 1 root root 63 1970-01-01 00:00 json.txt<br />\n-r&#8212;&#8212;&#8211; 1 root root 45 1970-01-01 00:00 profile.txt<br />\n[/sourcecode]</p>\n<p>For JSON values that are strings I used the key name for the file, with an added .txt extension.

            "content_text": "With the basics of a Google+ API announced last week I started poking around.  I liked that there was an option to simply sign up for an API key, allowing me to quickly try it out from the command line using cURL.  The JSON formatted results were easy enough to understand.\nThat led to hooking up FUSE and Python to provide the ability to mount the people.get data as a filesystem.  A bit more hacking and gplusfs was born.  It is still basic, but has been working fine so far with my profile.  This is all still read-only, since the Google+ API is read-only.\nHere is what a directory listing of my profile looks like:\n[sourcecode lang=&#8221;plain&#8221;]\n&gt; ls -la *\n-r&#8212;&#8212;&#8211; 1 root root   57 1970-01-01 00:00 aboutMe.txt\n-r&#8212;&#8212;&#8211; 1 root root   12 1970-01-01 00:00 displayName.txt\n-r&#8212;&#8212;&#8211; 1 root root    4 1970-01-01 00:00 gender.txt\n-r&#8212;&#8212;&#8211; 1 root root   21 1970-01-01 00:00 id.txt\n-r&#8212;&#8212;&#8211; 1 root root 5117 1970-01-01 00:00 image.jpg\n-r&#8212;&#8212;&#8211; 1 root root   11 1970-01-01 00:00 kind.txt\n-r&#8212;&#8212;&#8211; 1 root root   45 1970-01-01 00:00 url.txt\norganizations:\ntotal 1\ndr&#8212;&#8212;&#8211; 2 root root  0 1970-01-01 00:00 ./\ndr&#8212;&#8212;&#8211; 2 root root  0 1970-01-01 00:00 ../\n-r&#8212;&#8212;&#8211; 1 root root 10 1970-01-01 00:00 work.txt\nurls:\ntotal 1\ndr&#8212;&#8212;&#8211; 2 root root  0 1970-01-01 00:00 ./\ndr&#8212;&#8212;&#8211; 2 root root  0 1970-01-01 00:00 ../\n-r&#8212;&#8212;&#8211; 1 root root 63 1970-01-01 00:00 json.txt\n-r&#8212;&#8212;&#8211; 1 root root 45 1970-01-01 00:00 profile.txt\n[/sourcecode]\nFor JSON values that are strings I used the key name for the file, with an added .txt extension.

I poked around a bit, but quickly put the idea on the shelf and worked on other things.  Fast forward to early 2011, after I got <a href=\"http://josephscott.org/archives/2011/05/an-irc-experiment-raifbot/\">raifbot</a> into a functional state I started taking a more serious look at WordPress + WebDAV.  As a concept this is definitely plausible, but after trying several different approaches I decided I wasn&#8217;t interested in dealing with the edge cases I ran into (<a href=\"http://nginx.org/\">nginx</a> not having built in support for <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chunked_transfer_encoding\">chunked encoding</a> was particularly irksome).</p>\n<p>Although I wasn&#8217;t happy with the WebDAV issues, I still kept thinking about ways we could expose WordPress resources as a filesystem.  A few weeks later I started experimenting with the idea of using FUSE to expose WordPress data as a filesystem.  It was a rough start, but I finally got it to a point where it was time to share with others and get more feedback.</p>\n<h3>Python</h3>\n<p>I don&#8217;t have much experience writing Python code, which isn&#8217;t surprising since my full time job has involved WordPress and WordPress related development (lots of PHP code).  Sure, I&#8217;ve tweaked a few Python scripts from time to time, read <a href=\"http://diveintopython.org/\">Dive Into Python</a> and toyed with some of the examples, but I&#8217;ve never sat down to write new code for a new project in Python until now. I welcome feedback on improving the code, just remember this is my first time sailing this ship, so be gentle <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f642.png\" alt=\"\ud83d\ude42\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /></p>\n<p>The requirements for running pressfs aren&#8217;t terribly exotic.  Obvious you need to have the FUSE library installed and the <a href=\"http://sourceforge.net/projects/fuse/files/fuse-python/\">fuse-python</a> bindings.  Other external libraries it uses include httplib2 and simplejson.  I think all of the other imported code are standard for most python installs.</p>\n<p>There are only a handful of examples and tutorials on getting started with fuse-python, which I had to experiment with repeatedly (along with tons of debugging) to figure out how the pieces fit together.  I&#8217;ll likely be posting tutorials and how-to&#8217;s about python-fuse, both to help others and to make sure I have a clear idea of how the various features work.</p>\n<h3>The WordPress Plugin</h3>\n<p>I choose to write a new WordPress plugin to expose the data I needed because I wanted to be able to tweak it on a whim.  Using JSON to exchange data was a nice bonus as well.  So for now at least you&#8217;ll need to have this active on any site that you want to use pressfs with.</p>\n<h3>Directory Layout</h3>\n<p>If you have pressfs mounted on <code>/var/wordpress</code> you&#8217;ll see something like this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>/var/wordress/categories/</li>\n<li>/var/wordpress/posts/</li>\n<li>/var/wordpress/tags/</li>\n<li>/var/wordpress/users/</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The categories directory will list all of the categories, using the category slug.  Each individual category is a directory with the following files in it: count, description, id, name, parent, and slug.  These all contain what you would expect.</p>\n<p>The posts directory lists the posts on your site, with the format of &lt;POSTID&gt;-&lt;NAME&gt; (or if NAME isn&#8217;t available &lt;POSTID&gt;-&lt;TITLE&gt;).  Each post directory has the following files in it: content, date-gmt, id, name, password, status, title, type, and url.  Shouldn&#8217;t be any surprises about the contents of each of those files.</p>\n<p>The tags directory lists the tags on your site, using the slug.  Each tag directory contains: count, description, id, name, and slug.</p>\n<p>The users directory lists all the users on your site, with directory entries using the username field.  Each user directory contains these files: display-name, email, id, login, nice-name, registered, and url.</p>\n<p>Want to see the description field for category photos:<br />\n<code>more /var/wordress/categories/photos/description</code></p>\n<p>Want to see the post body for the post id 123, which has the name summer-vacation:<br />\n<code>more /var/wordpress/posts/123-summer-vacation/content</code></p>\n<p>Want the email field from user josephscott:<br />\n<code>more /var/wordpress/users/josephscott/email</code></p>\n<h3>The Future</h3>\n<p>The largest limitation that I expect people to ask about is moving from read-only to allowing write operations.  The good news is that I already have experimental code that allows for writes of specific fields.  I have more testing and cleaning up of the code to do, but I intended to add write support in a future version.</p>\n<p>Next up is exposing more WordPress data.  I already have test code for exposing media upload files, so that will get added eventually.  Beyond that I&#8217;d like to expose other less obvious items as well, like settings.</p>\n<p>While I&#8217;ve revised this a few times before getting to this point, I&#8217;m not sure I&#8217;ve got everything just right.  For instance, is the current directory layout really the best way to go?  Don&#8217;t be surprised if there are significant changes as development goes along.</p>\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n<p>Now that I&#8217;ve gotten my feet wet with WordPress  + python-fuse I&#8217;m excited about doing more with this.  This was also a good way to start learning more Python, for something that resembles a real application, which I&#8217;ve wanted to do for some time now.</p>\n<p>In the short term I&#8217;d like to hear how this works (or doesn&#8217;t) for others.  If you run into a problem re-mount pressfs with <code>python pressfs.py /your/mount/point/ -d</code>, which will keep the process running in the foreground, with details on what each operation does (including errors).  That should provide enough details to figure out where the problem is.</p>\n",

I welcome feedback on improving the code, just remember this is my first time sailing this ship, so be gentle \nThe requirements for running pressfs aren&#8217;t terribly exotic.  Obvious you need to have the FUSE library installed and the fuse-python bindings.  Other external libraries it uses include httplib2 and simplejson.  I think all of the other imported code are standard for most python installs.\nThere are only a handful of examples and tutorials on getting started with fuse-python, which I had to experiment with repeatedly (along with tons of debugging) to figure out how the pieces fit together.  I&#8217;ll likely be posting tutorials and how-to&#8217;s about python-fuse, both to help others and to make sure I have a clear idea of how the various features work.\nThe WordPress Plugin\nI choose to write a new WordPress plugin to expose the data I needed because I wanted to be able to tweak it on a whim.  Using JSON to exchange data was a nice bonus as well.  So for now at least you&#8217;ll need to have this active on any site that you want to use pressfs with.\nDirectory Layout\nIf you have pressfs mounted on /var/wordpress you&#8217;ll see something like this:\n\n/var/wordress/categories/\n/var/wordpress/posts/\n/var/wordpress/tags/\n/var/wordpress/users/\n\nThe categories directory will list all of the categories, using the category slug.  Each individual category is a directory with the following files in it: count, description, id, name, parent, and slug.  These all contain what you would expect.\nThe posts directory lists the posts on your site, with the format of &lt;POSTID&gt;-&lt;NAME&gt; (or if NAME isn&#8217;t available &lt;POSTID&gt;-&lt;TITLE&gt;).  Each post directory has the following files in it: content, date-gmt, id, name, password, status, title, type, and url.  Shouldn&#8217;t be any surprises about the contents of each of those files.\nThe tags directory lists the tags on your site, using the slug.  Each tag directory contains: count, description, id, name, and slug.\nThe users directory lists all the users on your site, with directory entries using the username field.  Each user directory contains these files: display-name, email, id, login, nice-name, registered, and url.\nWant to see the description field for category photos:\nmore /var/wordress/categories/photos/description\nWant to see the post body for the post id 123, which has the name summer-vacation:\nmore /var/wordpress/posts/123-summer-vacation/content\nWant the email field from user josephscott:\nmore /var/wordpress/users/josephscott/email\nThe Future\nThe largest limitation that I expect people to ask about is moving from read-only to allowing write operations.  The good news is that I already have experimental code that allows for writes of specific fields.  I have more testing and cleaning up of the code to do, but I intended to add write support in a future version.\nNext up is exposing more WordPress data.  I already have test code for exposing media upload files, so that will get added eventually.  Beyond that I&#8217;d like to expose other less obvious items as well, like settings.\nWhile I&#8217;ve revised this a few times before getting to this point, I&#8217;m not sure I&#8217;ve got everything just right.  For instance, is the current directory layout really the best way to go?  Don&#8217;t be surprised if there are significant changes as development goes along.\nConclusion\nNow that I&#8217;ve gotten my feet wet with WordPress  + python-fuse I&#8217;m excited about doing more with this.  This was also a good way to start learning more Python, for something that resembles a real application, which I&#8217;ve wanted to do for some time now.\nIn the short term I&#8217;d like to hear how this works (or doesn&#8217;t) for others.  If you run into a problem re-mount pressfs with python pressfs.py /your/mount/point/ -d, which will keep the process running in the foreground, with details on what each operation does (including errors).  That should provide enough details to figure out where the problem is.",
