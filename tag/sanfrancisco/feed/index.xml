										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I spent the last week in San Francisco for <a href="http://automattic.com/">work</a> and that was my first time flying on <a href="http://jetblue.com/">JetBlue</a>.  I&#8217;ve heard plenty of good things about JetBlue and now I&#8217;m a fan.  There are the obvious things: TV for every seat, free head phones, normal head phone jack, etc.  But for me there is one feature above all, I can walk down the isle of the plane without having to hunch over!  According to the <a href="http://jetblue.com/about/whyyoulllike/about_whyairbusstats.html">stats for the Airbus A320</a> the cabin height is 7 feet 1 inch.  I&#8217;m not sure if that is the actual head room in the isle, but it was higher than the top of my head and that is what counts in this case.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m 6 foot 4 inches tall so I&#8217;m used to things not really being designed with my size in mind, which made my experience on JetBlue so pleasantly surprising.  I was in the first 11 rows of the plane as well, which have a little bit extra leg room.  If I have a choice in the future I&#8217;ll be selecting JetBlue.</p>
