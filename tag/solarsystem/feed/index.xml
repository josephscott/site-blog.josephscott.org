										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Big news in planetary circles, <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2006/TECH/space/08/24/pluto.ap/index.html">Pluto is no longer considered a planet</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
&#8230; the International Astronomical Union stripped Pluto of the planetary status it has held since its discovery in 1930.</p>
<p>Much-maligned Pluto doesn&#8217;t make the grade under the new rules for a planet: &#8220;a celestial body that is in orbit around the sun, has sufficient mass for its self-gravity to overcome rigid body forces so that it assumes a &#8230; nearly round shape, and has cleared the neighborhood around its orbit.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pluto is automatically disqualified because its oblong orbit overlaps with Neptune&#8217;s.  Instead, it will be reclassified in a new category of &#8220;dwarf planets,&#8221; similar to what long have been termed &#8220;minor planets.&#8221; The definition also lays out a third class of lesser objects that orbit the sun &#8212; &#8220;small solar system bodies,&#8221; a term that will apply to numerous asteroids, comets and other natural satellites.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Now we are down to 8: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune.  Pluto will have to start eating with a different lunch crowd, hanging out with the likes of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1_Ceres">Ceres</a> (an asteroid that was also demoted from planet status) and <a href="http://www.gps.caltech.edu/~mbrown/planetlila/">2003 UB313</a> (who really wants to be accepted by the cool planets).</p>
