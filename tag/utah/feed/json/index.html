            "content_text": "Recently we drove down to Delta, Utah to visit the Topaz War Relocation Center.  If Topaz doesn&#8217;t sound familiar, you might know it by another term.  It was a Japanese internment camp.\n\nThis is something we&#8217;ve talked about doing for awhile, and now that some of the kids are a little older, it felt like the right time.  It is important that the next generation have something tangible to remember about the era of Japanese internment in the United States.  I was able to hear first hand accounts from people I&#8217;ve known who were in the internment camps in their youth.  As time goes on, that is going to happen less and less.\nThe location of the camp itself is mostly empty desert now.  One square mile of open land, with very little to see.\n\nIn one corner of the old camp there are three markers and an American flag.
