										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After reading Ben Thompsen&#8217;s take on <a href="https://stratechery.com/2016/the-voters-decide/">Trump communicating directly with voters</a> I was surprised to see no mention of Twitter.  Meanwhile there are 15 references to Facebook.</p>
<p>I get it, Facebook is enormous, and bigger than Twitter.  That doesn&#8217;t change that fact that the preferred medium in this particular case has been Twitter.</p>
<p>From <a href="https://stratechery.com/2016/the-voters-decide/">The Voters Decide</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
my focus is the business and strategy of technology, something that is inextricably linked with the effect technological change has and will have on society broadly — and that includes politics.
</p></blockquote>
<p>You can&#8217;t have a serious discussion about how the Internet and technology have changed the communication dynamics during this election cycle without including Twitter.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I disagree with <a href="http://stratechery.com/2013/casting-stones/">Ben Thompson about the business model impact on Apple and Google</a>.  Specifically this line from Apple&#8217;s report on government requests:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Unlike many other companies dealing with requests for customer data from government agencies, Apple’s main business is not about collecting information. As a result, the vast majority of the requests we receive from law enforcement seek information about lost or stolen devices, and are logged as device requests.</p>
<p>We have no interest in amassing personal information about our customers. We protect personal conversations by providing end-to-end encryption over iMessage and FaceTime. We do not store location data, Maps searches, or Siri requests in any identifiable form.
</p></blockquote>
<p>To which Ben said:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Many were quick to praise Apple for this very fact, but let’s be clear: there is nothing here worth praising. It’s an artifact of their business model.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Just like company culture, a business model has a large impact on a company.  Some build out specific cultures and models, others inherit them through lack of action.  Praising it might be too much, but so is completely dismissing it.</p>
<p>I certainly wouldn&#8217;t excuse the actions of patent trolls as just an artifact of their business model.</p>
