Small chit chat and eventually he started his pitch for the products and services they were selling.

He ignored my request and kept on talking as if I hadn&#8217;t said anything.  So I repeated my request.  He still kept going, at this point clearly ignoring what I was saying.  Repeated it a third time, and he still kept going.  At this point I started getting mad.  So in a very loud and firm voice I told him that I couldn&#8217;t believe was completely ignoring me just so that he could continue on with his sales pitch.  He still kept going.</p>\n<p>Then I hung up.</p>\n<p>About 45 seconds later I realized that if I didn&#8217;t do something I was going to keep getting calls like this.
