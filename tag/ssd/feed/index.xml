										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Over the last month or two I&#8217;ve heard from a number of people who have had Solid-State Drives (SSD) fail.  The first couple of times I heard this I thought it was odd.  After the fifth time (all from different people) I began to worry about a potential trend.  All of these were in computer systems, being used as primary storage (what most of us use hard drives for).</p>
<p>What I don&#8217;t know is who made all of these drives.  It&#8217;s entirely possible (although seems unlikely) that they were all made by the same vendor, who is having some serious problems.</p>
<p>This is completely unscientific, but I&#8217;ve heard this enough times to make note of it.</p>
