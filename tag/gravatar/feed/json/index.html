After coming across another one recently and not finding a Javascript library that would do this for me, I sat down to play with this process a bit.  I knew the process wasn&#8217;t complex, but at the same time it seemed like something that should have an easy to use drop in module to make it work.  The result is a simple jQuery plugin I&#8217;m calling <a href=\"http://josephscott.org/code/javascript/form2gravatar/\">form2gravatar</a>.</p>\n<p>The source code is available at <a href=\"https://github.com/josephscott/form2gravatar\">https://github.com/josephscott/form2gravatar</a>, along with a simple demo at <a href=\"http://josephscott.org/code/javascript/form2gravatar/\">http://josephscott.org/code/javascript/form2gravatar/</a>.  To get started you need a form field, and a target image element:</p>\n<p>[sourcecode lang=&#8221;html&#8221;]<br />\n&lt;div&gt;<br />\n\tEmail &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;email&quot; id=&quot;email&quot;&gt;<br />\n&lt;/div&gt;<br />\n&lt;div&gt;<br />\n\t&lt;img src=&quot;http:////www.gravatar.com/avatar/00000000000000000000000000000000?d=mm&amp;s=64&quot; id=&quot;gravatar&quot; alt=&quot;Gravatar&quot; height=&quot;64&quot; width=&quot;64&quot;&gt;<br />\n&lt;/div&gt;<br />\n[/sourcecode]</p>\n<p>Assuming you&#8217;ve loaded jQuery and form2gravatar.js you can then trigger a Gravatar image lookup with:</p>\n<p>[sourcecode lang=&#8221;javascript&#8221;]<br />\n$( &#8216;#email&#8217; ).form2gravatar( { target: &#8216;#gravatar&#8217; } );<br />\n[/sourcecode]</p>\n<p>This tells form2gravatar to watch the keystrokes in the <code>#email</code> element and update the <code>#gravatar</code> image.  By default it will check the form value several times a second, which makes it easy to update the image rapidly, but might be a waste in some cases.  So there is an option to only do an image update when the form field loses focus (<code>use_blue</code>).  </p>\n<p>For pages with several form fields setting <code>use_blur</code> to true will still provide a good experience and have almost no performance impact on the page.  If you only have a few form fields (like on a log in page) I&#8217;d stick with the default behavior.  You can adjust how frequently the form field is checked with the <code>timer_interval</code> option.</p>\n<p>Here is a list of all the options in form2gravatar:</p>\n<p>[sourcecode lang=&#8221;javascript&#8221;]<br />\n\tvar opt = {<br />\n\t\t&#8216;default_img&#8217;\t: &#8216;mm&#8217;,<br />\n\t\t&#8216;size&#8217;\t\t    : 64,<br />\n\t\t&#8216;ssl&#8217;\t\t    : false,<br />\n\t\t&#8216;target&#8217;\t    : false,<br />\n\t\t&#8216;timer_interval&#8217;: 100,<br />\n\t\t&#8216;use_blur&#8217;\t    : false<br />\n\t};<br />\n[/sourcecode]</p>\n<p>The only one that is required is <code>target</code>.  The other option many folks will want look at is <code>default_img</code>, which by default uses the mystery man from Gravatar.  You can use any of the other <a href=\"https://en.gravatar.com/site/implement/images/\">Gravatar default options</a> (404, mm, identicon, monsterid, wavatar, retro, and blank) along with a URL to some other image.</p>\n<p>The Github repo includes a demo.html file that shows this in use for sign in page.
