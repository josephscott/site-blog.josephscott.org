										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If this article from the New York Times is a representative sample of what <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/08/15/magazine/bad-paper-debt-collector.html">the world of debt collections</a> looks like then it is past time to look at better regulations ( emphasis is mine ):</p>
<blockquote><p>
As he soon discovered, after creditors sell off unpaid debts, those debts enter a financial netherworld where strange things can happen. A gamut of players — including debt buyers, collectors, brokers, street hustlers and criminals — all work together, and against one another, to recoup every penny on every dollar. In this often-lawless marketplace, large portfolios of debt — <strong>usually in the form of spreadsheets holding debtors’ names, contact information and balances</strong> — are bought, sold and sometimes simply stolen.
</p></blockquote>
<p>The idea that all you need to have to support your claim that you now own the rights to a specific amount of debt is an entry on a spreadsheet is terrifying.  Who lets a financial marketplace run in such a crazy fashion?</p>
