										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>James Hamilton on <a href="http://perspectives.mvdirona.com/2015/05/the-return-to-the-cloud/">Zynga shutting down data centers and moving back to AWS</a> ( emphasis mine ):</p>
<blockquote><p>
These days, there is more data available and it’s fairly easy to show that <strong>“being at scale” requires order 10^6 servers</strong>, deep investments in server and networking equipment and the software stacks above, and massive investments in the software stack that manages these resources.
</p></blockquote>
<p>You read that correctly, if you have fewer than 1,000,000 servers you are not &#8220;at scale&#8221;.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>James Hamilton on <a href="http://perspectives.mvdirona.com/2013/11/datacenter-renewable-power-done-right/">Datacenter Renewable Power Done Right</a> ( back in 2013 ):</p>
<blockquote><p>
how can running a low-scale power plant on a fossil fuel possibly be green and is on-site generation really going to be the most environmentally conscious means of powering data centers? Most datacenters lack space for large on-site generation facilities, most datacenter operators don’t have the skill, and generally the most efficient power generation plants are far bigger than a single datacenter could ever consume on its worst day.
</p></blockquote>
<p>His key point about on-site power generation at datacenters:</p>
<blockquote><p>
I still find myself skeptical that the world leaders in operating efficient and reliable power plans are going to be datacenter operators.
</p></blockquote>
<p>This may be a legitimate concern.  Then again, fifteen years ago I wouldn&#8217;t have guessed that Amazon would come to define pay as you go servers and services ( &#8220;the cloud&#8221; ).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you are really into the nuts and bolts of data centers, large scale networks, and large scale computing then <a href="http://perspectives.mvdirona.com/">James Hamilton</a>&#8216;s posts make for some good reading.  He&#8217;s a &#8220;Vice President and Distinguished Engineer on the Amazon Web Services team&#8221;, which is really just the tip of the iceberg in his <a href="http://mvdirona.com/jrh/work/">work history</a>.</p>
<p>So why read his posts?  Because he talks about some of the hard problems faced in the world of data centers.  Take for instance his recent <a href="http://perspectives.mvdirona.com/2010/04/09/HighScaleNetworkResearch.aspx">High Scale Network Research</a> post.  How would you put together a reasonably priced test bed to stress your new network configuration/hardware that has to support 10,000 servers?</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll be honest, I don&#8217;t fully understand everything that James writes.  That&#8217;s part of the reason why he&#8217;s on my recommended reading list, trying to follow along makes me work intellectually.</p>
