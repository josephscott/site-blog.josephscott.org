										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was reviewing the waterfall results from a <a href="https://www.webpagetest.org/">WebPageTest.org</a> test recently and I came across a third party resource that look 5 seconds to do a DNS lookup:</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/dns-time.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/dns-time-1024x644.jpg" alt="" width="840" height="528" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-16388" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/dns-time-1024x644.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/01/dns-time-300x189.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/01/dns-time-768x483.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/01/dns-time.jpg 1192w" sizes="(max-width: 840px) 100vw, 840px" /></a></p>
<p>To be exact it took 5.031 seconds.  The parameters of the test itself were nothing exciting, Chrome from Virginia with the &#8220;Cable&#8221; network profile ( 5/1 Mbps, 28 ms RTT ).  The DNS lookup for the initial page request only took 0.059 seconds, so this wasn&#8217;t a function of the test parameters.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/dns-time-bar.png"><img loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/dns-time-bar.png" alt="" width="814" height="40" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16392" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/dns-time-bar.png 814w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/01/dns-time-bar-300x15.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/01/dns-time-bar-768x38.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 814px) 100vw, 814px" /></a></p>
<p>When you see an entry like that it is a good reminder not to take DNS performance for granted.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>All these years and I&#8217;d never come across <strong>.invalid</strong>.  From <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2606">RFC 2606</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
There is a need for top level domain (TLD) names that can be used for<br />
creating names which, without fear of conflicts with current or<br />
future actual TLD names in the global DNS, can be used for private<br />
testing of existing DNS related code, examples in documentation, DNS<br />
related experimentation, invalid DNS names, or other similar uses.</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p>To safely satisfy these needs, four domain names are reserved as<br />
listed and described below.</p>
<pre>
                   .test
                .example
                .invalid
              .localhost
</pre>
<p>&#8220;.test&#8221; is recommended for use in testing of current or new DNS<br />
related code.</p>
<p>&#8220;.example&#8221; is recommended for use in documentation or as examples.</p>
<p>&#8220;.invalid&#8221; is intended for use in online construction of domain<br />
names that are sure to be invalid and which it is obvious at a<br />
glance are invalid.</p>
<p>The &#8220;.localhost&#8221; TLD has traditionally been statically defined in<br />
host DNS implementations as having an A record pointing to the<br />
loop back IP address and is reserved for such use.  Any other use<br />
would conflict with widely deployed code which assumes this use.
</p></blockquote>
<p>On a related note, RFC 2606 is also where <code>example.com</code>, <code>example.net</code>, and <code>example.edu</code> are reserved.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>ICANN ( the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers ), the people responsible the IPv4 &#038; IPv6 address space and the top-level domain ( TLDs ) space, are rolling out a large <a href="http://newgtlds.icann.org/en/program-status/delegated-strings" title=".PLUMBING really?">list of new top-level domains</a>.  Tired of being limited to the traditional .com / .net / .org and country domains?  Soon you&#8217;ll have a bizarre set of new possibilities.</p>
<p>Here is a sample of what is coming:</p>
<pre>
.DOMAINS
.RECIPES
.NINJA
.EMAIL
.ZONE
.MONASH
.XYZ
.FISH
</pre>
<p>Some of these have obvious categories, like .recipes for recipe web sites.  Others I think are just random names people pulled out of a hat, like .ninja.</p>
<p>The title of this post, Dot Kitchen Sink, was meant to be a joke, but there is some truth to it.  On the list  of new TLDs is .kitchen, so you could have a joseph@sink.kitchen email address or joseph.kitchen/sink/ as a web site.  Telling someone your email address in a voice conversation is only going to get harder.</p>
<p>Time to go all the way with dot.dot just to make things even more confusing <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I noticed when trying to reach <a href="http://www.freebsd.org/">www.freebsd.org</a> the last week on a mac that it took forever, just sitting there spinning on an empty page.  But on the same network in loaded right away on a Windows XP system.  I thought that was rather odd, but moved on and didn&#8217;t think about it again until last night.  I tried it again and noticed the same problem, using any browser on the mac it never loaded, on Windows XP showed up right away.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s when a little inspiration showed up.  I knew that www.freebsd.org was also available via IPv6, I wonder if Mac OS X was trying to reach it via IPv6 first.  If it was then it would never succeed as my DSL provides IPv4 and I don&#8217;t have a IPv6 tunnel setup.  First I confirmed that www.freebsd.org had an IPv6 address, <code>host www.freebsd.org</code> provided this:</p>
<p>[sourcecode highlight=&#8221;2&#8243;]<br />
www.freebsd.org has address 69.147.83.33<br />
www.freebsd.org has IPv6 address 2001:4f8:fff6::21<br />
www.freebsd.org mail is handled by 0 .<br />
[/sourcecode]</p>
<p>The second line there confirmed that there was indeed an IPv6 DNS address for www.freebsd.org.</p>
<p>Next was a quick trip to the network preferences on the mac.  Click the &#8216;Advanced&#8217; button for your network connection and under the TCP/IP section you&#8217;ll see an option labeled &#8216;Configure IPv6&#8217;.  Mine was set to &#8216;Automatically&#8217;, which I then changed to &#8216;Off&#8217;.  Click &#8216;OK&#8217; then &#8216;Apply&#8217;.  That turned off IPv6 support for my network connection on the mac.</p>
<p>And sure enough www.freebsd.org loaded up right away again after that.</p>
<p>If you aren&#8217;t using IPv6 on your network then it&#8217;s probably worth just turning it off.  I&#8217;m rather surprised that I didn&#8217;t run into this sooner.  I guess there aren&#8217;t that many websites out there advertising IPv6 addresses.</p>
<p><b>Update:</b> I noticed that us2.php.net has an IPv6 address listed as well, which explains why I&#8217;d had problems loading that site too.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.qwest.com/">Qwest</a> has started redirecting DNS queries to their own servers.  Not because I asked them to, they did it to start pushing their own search results page when DNS queries failed (like so many others have and some still do).  This new &#8220;service&#8221; is called <a href="http://www.qwest.net/web.help/">Web.Help</a>.  In order to do this they reset my DSL line this morning (which was irritating), but they did at least provide some links on what this.</p>
<p>After reading through some of their information on their new &#8220;service&#8221; I found a link indicating that I could opt out (not that I ever opted in).  I&#8217;m not sure what they were thinking here though, instead of the &#8220;opt out&#8221; taking me to a page where I could opt out, it took me to another documentation page on their new service.  I had to dig through three or four layers of &#8220;opt out&#8221; links before I got to a page that would actually turn this off.  Which of course reset my DSL connection again about 5 minutes later.  We&#8217;ll see where this ends up.</p>
<p>The search results they were showing for failed DNS queries were from <a href="http://yahoo.com/">Yahoo</a>.  I wonder if Yahoo is paying Qwest to do this.</p>
