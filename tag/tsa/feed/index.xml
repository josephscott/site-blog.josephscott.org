										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Episode 9 of the TV show The West Wing ( &#8220;The Short List&#8221; ) dealt with how a U.S. Supreme Court Justice nominee might rule in regards to privacy.  The main question being, did a right to privacy exist at all?</p>
<p>This episode aired at the end of 1999, but it has a brief segment that could have been said yesterday:</p>
<a href="/2013/10/16/the-privacy-decades/"><img src="/wp-content/plugins/wp-youtube-lyte/lyteCache.php?origThumbUrl=%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2Fpj4PwyfDNuI%2Fhqdefault.jpg" alt="YouTube Video"></a><br /><br /></p>
<p>Rough transcription (emphasis mine):</p>
<blockquote><p>
It&#8217;s about the next 20 years. </p>
<p>Twenties and thirties, it was the role of government.  Fifties and sixties, it was civil rights. <strong>The next two decades, are gonna be privacy</strong>.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m talking about the Internet.  I&#8217;m talking about cellphones.  I&#8217;m talking about health records, and who&#8217;s gay and who&#8217;s not. And moreover, in a country born on a will to be free, what could be more fundamental than this?
</p></blockquote>
<p>Think of all the restrictions on privacy that have happened since 1999, from the TSA to the recent revelations of the NSA spying on Americans.  The question of a right to privacy is even more critical today than it was 14 years ago.</p>
