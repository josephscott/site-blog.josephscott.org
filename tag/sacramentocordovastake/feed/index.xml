										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The June 2005 stake conference for the Sacramento Cordova California Stake (of <a href="http://www.lds.org/">The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints</a>) was last weekend (18-19 June 2005).  We were privileged to have Elder Richard G. Scott (of the Quorum of Twelve Apostles ) and Elder Won Yong Ko (a new Area Authority Seventy), who were there to call a new Stake President.  Donald G. Pebbles was released as Stake President, having served in that position for nine years.  Alan Fisher (previously the 1st Counselor in the Stake Presidency) was called as the new Stake President.  His counselors are Roy Bair and Craig Norman, both of whom were previously serving on the Stake High Council.</p>
<p>This was terrific conference.  Seeing Elder Scott use <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop/main.html">Adobe Photoshop</a> during some of his talks was a bit of a surprise.  For some reason this just struck me as neat.</p>
