Pebbles was released as Stake President, having served in that position for nine years.  Alan Fisher (previously the 1st Counselor in the Stake Presidency) was called as the new Stake President.  His counselors are Roy Bair and Craig Norman, both of whom were previously serving on the Stake High Council.</p>\n<p>This was terrific conference.  Seeing Elder Scott use <a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop/main.html\">Adobe Photoshop</a> during some of his talks was a bit of a surprise.
