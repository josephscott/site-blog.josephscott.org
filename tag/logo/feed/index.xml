					<description><![CDATA[&#160; The Mozilla Weave project released version 0.3 recently and their logo looked really familiar. Perhaps it was the long lost brother of the Microsoft BackOffice logo?

<p>The <a href="http://labs.mozilla.com/projects/weave/">Mozilla Weave</a> project released <a href="http://labs.mozilla.com/2009/03/weave-03-released/">version 0.3</a> recently and their logo looked really familiar.  Perhaps it was the long lost brother of the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/PRODUCTS/servers/designed/">Microsoft BackOffice</a> logo?</p>
<p>Maybe it&#8217;s just because I worked in an IT department many years ago where that BackOffice logo seemed to be everywhere, but I can&#8217;t look at that Weave logo without thinking of BackOffice.  It&#8217;s like a shiny monochrome version of Microsoft&#8217;s rainbow.</p>
<p>What do you think, definite relation, or am I just scarred from my time with Microsoft BackOffice all those years ago?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://static.flickr.com/27/39357357_7f708ac681_t.jpg" align="left" alt="Sac State Logo" />The <a href="http://www.csus.edu/pa/logo/logo/logo1.stm">new Sacramento State logo</a> was <a href="http://www.csus.edu/pa/identity/">announced today</a>.  Along with the new logo, the <a href="http://www.csus.edu/">main website</a> launched a new design.</p>
<p>The response around the office has been mixed.  Myself and a few others first thought of a torch, while others thought the two Ss looked too much like dollar signs.  I certainly like it much more than the old <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/josephscott/39357358/">seal style logo</a>.  I also prefer the new website to <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.csus.edu">the old one</a>.  I don&#8217;t like how the new site requires Javascript for even basic functionality.  In many places the underlines for linked text has been removed, but kept in others.  In some cases there is nothing short of a mouse over to provide any indication that some chunk of text is a link.</p>
<p>All of this means new business cards, new signs and more hassle for everyone while we try to integrate the new logo.  I still like it better than the old one though.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE 7:45pm 1 Sep 2005:</strong> Here&#8217;s the <a href="http://www.csus.edu/news/090105newlogo.stm">official announcement</a> about the new identity package.</p>
