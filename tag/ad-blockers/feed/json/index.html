In many places where ads appear, the site will simply feature more articles, said Mark McClusky, the magazine\u2019s head of product and business development. The portion of his readership that uses ad blockers are likely to be receptive to a discussion about their  responsibility to support the businesses they rely on for  information online, McClusky said.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>This feels like a challenge.
