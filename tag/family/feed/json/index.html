A big thank you to the folks at <a href=\"http://www.suttermedicalcenter.org/\">Sutter Memorial Hospital</a> for doing a great job.  We were happy with how things went when Alice was born there and we were happy to see them still doing a great job with Rachel.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve been ramping Alice up for quite some time on the idea of being a big sister.  She took to it really well, but you never really know how things will go until the new child actually shows up.  To her credit Alice was excited and did very well when seeing Rachel for the first time.  She was excited to hold the new baby and made sure to explain to anyone who would listen that this was her baby and that she was the big sister.  Not bad for a 4 year old.</p>\n",
