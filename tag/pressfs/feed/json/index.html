I poked around a bit, but quickly put the idea on the shelf and worked on other things.  Fast forward to early 2011, after I got <a href=\"http://josephscott.org/archives/2011/05/an-irc-experiment-raifbot/\">raifbot</a> into a functional state I started taking a more serious look at WordPress + WebDAV.  As a concept this is definitely plausible, but after trying several different approaches I decided I wasn&#8217;t interested in dealing with the edge cases I ran into (<a href=\"http://nginx.org/\">nginx</a> not having built in support for <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chunked_transfer_encoding\">chunked encoding</a> was particularly irksome).</p>\n<p>Although I wasn&#8217;t happy with the WebDAV issues, I still kept thinking about ways we could expose WordPress resources as a filesystem.  A few weeks later I started experimenting with the idea of using FUSE to expose WordPress data as a filesystem.

Sure, I&#8217;ve tweaked a few Python scripts from time to time, read <a href=\"http://diveintopython.org/\">Dive Into Python</a> and toyed with some of the examples, but I&#8217;ve never sat down to write new code for a new project in Python until now. I welcome feedback on improving the code, just remember this is my first time sailing this ship, so be gentle <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f642.png\" alt=\"\ud83d\ude42\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /></p>\n<p>The requirements for running pressfs aren&#8217;t terribly exotic.

Other external libraries it uses include httplib2 and simplejson.  I think all of the other imported code are standard for most python installs.</p>\n<p>There are only a handful of examples and tutorials on getting started with fuse-python, which I had to experiment with repeatedly (along with tons of debugging) to figure out how the pieces fit together.
