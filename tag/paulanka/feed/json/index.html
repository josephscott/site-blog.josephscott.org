He also has a new album out, <a href=\"http://www.vervemusicgroup.com/product.aspx?pid=11276&amp;ob=bf&amp;src=lb\">Rock Swings</a>.  Ordinarily I wouldn&#8217;t find this very noteworthy, but this CD is a bit different.</p>\n<p>All of the tracks on Rock Swings are swing arrangements of 80s songs.  The tracks are available on <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/itunes/\">iTunes</a> so go listen to the 30 second samples.  It&#8217;s fun to listen to these familiar songs done in a completely different way.  Some of the songs are harder to recognize than others, so you may want to check out the <a href=\"http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewPublishedPlaylist?id=369426\">iTunes iMix with the new and original tracks</a>, for easy comparison.</p>\n",
