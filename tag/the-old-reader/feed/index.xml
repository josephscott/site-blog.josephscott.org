										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve tried a few different feed reader options in the run up to the close of Google Reader.  I really wanted to like Feedly, but there were two main issues.  The one that I noticed first is that it didn&#8217;t work well for my reading style.  The second issue that came up became a deal breaker, there was no way to export my list of subscriptions.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://sharedat.net/f/HE/HETD/the-old-reader.png" width="347" height="249" class="aligncenter" /></p>
<p>Eventually I landed at <a href="http://theoldreader.com/">The Old Reader</a>.  Their UI better fit my reading style and I can export my feed list as an OPML file.</p>
<p>The Old Reader isn&#8217;t perfect.  There are some UI elements that are a bit clunky.  But over all my reading experience in The Old Reader was better than Feedly.</p>
<p>I may try other alternatives again as things continue to improve and settle in the reader market (post Google Reader).</p>
