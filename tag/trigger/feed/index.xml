										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was recently working on a page that had some existing transitions that happened when a user clicked on an item.  My thought was to periodically trigger a click event that would automate the process some what, allowing me to take advantage of the existing transition code.</p>
<p>jQuery has a nifty method called <a href="http://api.jquery.com/trigger/">.trigger</a> that takes care of firing the click event for me.  Very handy, but then I quickly realized that I needed to be able to tell the difference between a human click event and a <code>.trigger</code>&#8216;d click event.</p>
<p>Fortunately I wasn&#8217;t the only one to have run into this issue and there is a solution described at <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6692031/check-if-event-is-triggered-by-a-human/6692173#6692173">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6692031/check-if-event-is-triggered-by-a-human/6692173#6692173</a>.  The key is <code>event.originalEvent</code>, here is an example from the StackOverflow post:</p>
<p>[sourcecode lang=&#8221;javascript&#8221;]<br />
$( &quot;#click-me&quot; ).click( function( event ) {<br />
    if ( event.originalEvent === undefined ) {<br />
        alert( &#8216;not human&#8217; )<br />
    } else {<br />
        alert( &#8216;human&#8217; );<br />
    }<br />
} );<br />
[/sourcecode]</p>
<p>You can also try it out on jsFiddle &#8211; <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/Uf8Wv/">http://jsfiddle.net/Uf8Wv/</a></p>
<p>This appears to be specific to jQuery, which in this case wasn&#8217;t a big deal since all of the other code on the page was using jQuery as well.  The <a href="http://api.jquery.com/category/events/event-object/">Event object</a> documentation mentions <code>event.originalEvent</code>, but doesn&#8217;t indicate that it can be used in this way.</p>
