										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If <a href="https://josephscott.org/archives/2016/02/malware-museum/">DOS malware</a> isn&#8217;t your thing, how about <a href="https://archive.org/details/softwarelibrary_win3">Windows 3.x software</a>?  From <a href="http://blog.archive.org/2016/02/11/internet-archive-does-windows-hundreds-of-windows-3-1-programs-join-the-collection/">the announcement on this collection</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
We’ve now added over 1,000 programs that run, in your browser, in a Windows 3.1 environment. This includes many games, lots of utilities and business software, and what would best be called “Apps” of the 1990s – programs that did something simple, like provide a calculator or a looping animation, that could be done by an individual or small company to great success.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;ll suggest one: <a href="https://archive.org/details/win3_WINTREKJ">Wintrek</a>:</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Internet Archive once again preserves a fascinating bit of computer history, from the MS-DOS era:</p>
<blockquote><p>
The Malware Museum is a collection of malware programs, usually viruses, that were distributed in the 1980s and 1990s on home computers. Once they infected a system, they would sometimes show animation or messages that you had been infected. Through the use of emulations, and additionally removing any destructive routines within the viruses, this collection allows you to experience virus infection of decades ago with safety.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Now be honest, of all the things that you thought might show up in the Archive at some point, was a <a href="https://archive.org/details/malwaremuseum?sort=-publicdate">malware museum</a> really on your list?</p>
<p>Another angle used for evil during that same period were <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI.SYS#Keyboard_remapping">ANSI bombs</a>.  Some times it is safer to have fewer features rather than more.</p>

<p>The ability to play some of these games in the browser is really impressive.</p>
