<p>At 2:40pm on Wednesday 29 July 2009 our third child (and first boy) was born.  Everything went smoothly, Sarah was in labor for 7 hours and only pushed for 5 minutes.  Both Sarah and Michael are doing fine.</p>
<p>Our girls are very excited to have a new baby brother.  When Sarah went into the hospital they started telling everyone (including strangers, anyone within hearing range) that they were going have a new baby Michael today.  Not everyone knew what they were talking about, but that&#8217;s okay.  Later they came to the hospital to visit and hold Michael for the first time.</p>
<p>It really is amazing how tiny we are when we start this life.  And how quickly we grow and develop new skills.  For now we are just going to enjoy having a tiny baby that is healthy and strong.</p>
<p>Welcome to our family Michael, everyone is excited to meet you.  We love you and look forward to teaching you about this amazing world that we live in.</p>
