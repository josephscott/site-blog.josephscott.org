										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This seems to have been the week to announce purchases of blogs and blogging resources.  First up, <a href="http://weblogsinc.com/">Weblogs, Inc.</a> was <a href="http://www.paidcontent.org/pc/arch/2005_10_05.shtml#051691">sold to AOL</a>.  Later on we learned that <a href="http://weblogs.com/">Weblogs.com</a> was sold to <a href="http://verisign.com/">Verisign</a>.  Congrats to both Jason and Dave on these deals, they&#8217;ve both worked hard on these resources and deserve this success.</p>
<p>Both these deals have left me with more questions though.  What does AOL see in Weblogs, Inc?  Nothing against Weblogs, Inc, but AOL is huge, what attracted them enough to make a purchasing offer?  And what is up with <a href="http://archive.scripting.com/2005/10/07#whatADay">Dave Winer selling weblogs.com to Verisign</a>?  Verisign?  As others have already noted it was certainly time to weblogs.com to be run with deeper pockets and Dave probably wants to move on and do other things.  But Verisign?  The company that has been considered evil for at least the last 10 years?  I don&#8217;t trust Verisign and I won&#8217;t be surprised if they make some very foolish decisions over the next few years with weblogs.com.</p>
