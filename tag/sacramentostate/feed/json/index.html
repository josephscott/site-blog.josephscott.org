I also prefer the new website to <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.csus.edu\">the old one</a>.  I don&#8217;t like how the new site requires Javascript for even basic functionality.  In many places the underlines for linked text has been removed, but kept in others.  In some cases there is nothing short of a mouse over to provide any indication that some chunk of text is a link.</p>\n<p>All of this means new business cards, new signs and more hassle for everyone while we try to integrate the new logo.
