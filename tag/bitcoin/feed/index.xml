										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With some rough math Aaron Toponce comes up with an estimate for <a href="https://pthree.org/2016/01/30/bitcoin-mining-rate-and-waste/">Bitcoin Mining Rate and Waste</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
At $0.15 USD per kWh, that&#8217;s $609 spent on electricity per Bitcoin mined. Bitcoin is currently trading at $376/BTC.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Using the ~$600 cost in electricity for current mining rates, Bitcoin would need to go back to the highs of <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/charts">2013 and 2014</a> to have a net positive value.</p>
<p>Aaron is very direct in his conclusion:</p>
<blockquote><p>
I would argue that Bitcoin is the worst idea to come out of Computer Science in the history of mankind.
</p></blockquote>
<p>If this depends on the price per Bitcoin, then this conclusion needs to have more flexibility.  It may be that we are too early in the history of Bitcoin to write a conclusion.</p>
<p>In terms of overall issues with Bitcoin, I don&#8217;t think this one is big enough by itself to kill Bitcoin.  Combined with other issues though, it may prove unsustainable over all.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;d heard that the Bitcoin value against the U.S. dollar has recently dropped, so I headed over to <a href="https://coinbase.com/charts" title="All your bitcoin are belong to us.">coinbase.com/charts</a> to see the actual trends.  This is what that page showed:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/coinbase-wrong-1.jpg" alt="coinbase-wrong" width="800" height="396" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-9650" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/coinbase-wrong-1.jpg 800w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/12/coinbase-wrong-1-300x149.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/12/coinbase-wrong-1-768x380.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p>The error message in red is:</p>
<blockquote><p>
We&#8217;re sorry, but something went wrong.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure if that was supposed to be a commentary on a possible Bitcoin bubble or a real error message.</p>
<p>I found the trend data I was looking for at <a href="https://www.mtgox.com/" title="What is the story with that domain name?">mtgox.com</a>.  Turns out the value at the beginning of this month was in the range of $1,200 U.S. for a single Bitcoin.  Eighteen days later it was just under $600.  I believe the technical term for that would be &#8220;highly volatile&#8221;.</p>

Would it even need to in order to get a decent number of people to use it?</p>
<p>If an existing sizable bank started trying out Bitcoin that would be a significant move.  I would imagine a number of regulatory issues would come up.</p>
