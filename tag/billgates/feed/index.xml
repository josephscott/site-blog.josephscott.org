										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.cnn.com/">CNN</a> is reporting that <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2006/US/06/15/gates.ap/index.html">Gates to leave day-to-day Microsoft operations</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Chairman Bill Gates announced Thursday that he will transition from day-to-day responsibilities at the company he co-founded to concentrate on the charitable work of the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation.</p>
<p>Gates will continue on as the company&#8217;s chairman after transferring his duties over a two-year period.<br />
&#8230;<br />
Microsoft&#8217;s Chief Technical Officer Ray Ozzie will immediately assume Gate&#8217;s title as chief software architect and begin working alongside Gates on overseeing all software technical design.
</p></blockquote>
<p>There will be two year transition so I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;ll be seeing major shifts until after that point.  I suspect many people will reference this as the beginning of the post-Bill Gates era of Microsoft.</p>
