All of the traditional HTML editor buttons are there; image, link, bold, italics, bullet lists, text color, font selection, text size, text alignment and text type (heading, subheading, minor heading and normal).  You can choose one of four different layouts and 41 styles.  For those of you who want to get in the guts you can also edit HTML directly.</p>\n<p>Just like some of their other recent service releases, the performance is very rough.  Although the editor usually works, saving can take quite a bit of time.  About half the time that I try to view my Google Pages home page it returns a 404 not found error.
