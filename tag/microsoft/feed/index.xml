<p>Twitter is still loosing money, but it is loosing a lot less than it was before.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t realize that Netflix was so low on the number of employees, yet their revenue is in the general ball park of much larger companies.  To the studios it must look like Netflix is over there printing money.  No wonder so many other companies want to start their own streaming content service.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today I&#8217;m joining the time honored tradition of making predictions for the new year.  Translation: wild guesses and obvious statements.</p>
<h4>1. <a href="http://www.apple.com/">Apple</a> Makes A Move To Improve Internet Services</h4>
<p>Perhaps Apple&#8217;s single biggest weak spot has been online services.  It is clear they know how to do a good job making hardware, all the way down to the chip level in some cases, and software to run on that hardware.  Execution of large scale Internet services hasn&#8217;t gone as smoothly.</p>
<p>In the past people have suggested that Apple might buy an existing company to help bring in large scale web DNA.  I think what is more likely is that Apple makes a few key high level hires that build out new teams.</p>
<p>This won&#8217;t be an easy thing for Apple.  When I look around at more recent successful web startups I see lots of sharing.  That will be a significant change of pace for a company that invests heavily in secrecy.</p>
<p>I consider <a href="https://swift.org/">Swift</a> going open source a positive sign.</p>
<h4>2. <a href="http://www.lua.org/">Lua</a> Gets More Attention</h4>
<p>Cloudflare has been pushing the <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/pushing-nginx-to-its-limit-with-lua/">Nginx + Lua</a> combination for years now.  I consider that particular combination one of the most under rated technology stacks around.</p>
<p>If you were heavy into all the microservices talk during 2015 then Lua+Nginx is an exciting combination.  I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if AWS launches a new service around Lua.</p>
<p>I recommend <a href="https://openresty.org/">OpenResty</a> ( a build of Nginx with Lua ) and <a href="http://lua.space/">lua.space</a> ( community news ).</p>
<h4>3. Flash First Video Becomes Shameful</h4>
<p>We have pretty good support for the <a href="http://caniuse.com/#feat=video">video element</a>, it is time to move Flash for video to a <a href="http://docs.webplatform.org/wiki/html/elements/video#Flash_fallback">fallback</a> position.  You are probably already doing that for mobile devices, time to go all in.</p>
<h4>4. More Open Source From Microsoft</h4>
<p>Microsoft has started to gain back some geek cred with their push into making more of their code open source ( check out <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft">https://github.com/Microsoft</a> ).  My prediction is they go even further, announcing one of their larger key products will go open source.  The big bets would be Exchange or SQL Server.  The other big candidate would a component of Office.</p>
<h4>5. Strange U.S. Presidential Politics</h4>
<p>If you&#8217;d asked about this a year ago, I would have focused on how much I&#8217;m not keen on family dynasties for President.  At the time Jeb Bush and Hillary Clinton were safe bets on being the candidates from their respective parties.  One had a brother and father who were President, the other a husband.  Since then there have been dramatic changes on the Republican side, and very little change on the Democratic side.</p>
<p>My prediction: things get even stranger before the general election.  This might be the year for a <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/contested-convention-almost-everything-you-need-know-n478736">contested convention</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>
Today, the Windows 10 Technical Preview was launched to give an early look at what’s next for Windows. Only available to install by joining the Windows Insider Program, the Technical Preview is also the best way to see the latest from Internet Explorer so join today. In this post we’re sharing what’s new for IE as well as launching the Internet Explorer Platform Suggestion Box for web developers to give us feature suggestions using the UserVoice platform.
</p></blockquote>
<p>At this point it feels like IE is being used as an upgrade stick for Windows.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Perhaps the scariest part of the <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/2963983" title="It goes alway the way back to IE 6.">recent remote execution vulnerability in Internet Explorer</a> is this thought from <a href="http://krebsonsecurity.com/2014/04/microsoft-warns-of-attacks-on-ie-zero-day/" title="Why isn't the 'Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit' shipped with Windows?">Brian Krebs</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
This is the first of many zero-day attacks and vulnerabilities that will never be fixed for Windows XP users. Microsoft last month shipped its final set of updates for XP. Unfortunately, many of the exploit mitigation techniques that EMET brings do not work in XP.
</p></blockquote>
<p>According to <a href="http://gs.statcounter.com/#os-US-monthly-201303-201403-bar" title="Their global stats site is super useful for this type of data.">StatCounter</a> Windows XP still accounts for 10% of systems browsing the web in the United States.  That includes mobile users too.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/statcounter-os-march-2014-1.jpg" title="More than Android?"><img loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/statcounter-os-march-2014-1.jpg" alt="statcounter-os-march-2014" width="845" height="540" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10383" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/statcounter-os-march-2014-1.jpg 845w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/04/statcounter-os-march-2014-1-300x192.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/04/statcounter-os-march-2014-1-768x491.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 845px) 100vw, 845px" /></a></p>
<p>When you look at the <a href="http://gs.statcounter.com/#all-os-ww-monthly-201303-201403-bar" title="I wonder which country has the highest use of Windows XP in the world.">world wide use</a> that 10% jumps to 16%.</p>
<p>I expect there are people who are still actively looking for holes in Windows XP.  It is only a matter of time before they find them.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was considering a test account <a href="http://outlook.com/">Outlook.com</a> today, just to give it a spin. So I started through the Microsoft Live signup process. It was going ok until I got to the password fields. I entered in one of my randomly generated 40 character passwords and was presented with this message:</p>
<figure style="width: 320px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://sharedat.net/s/CeBw9"><img loading="lazy" alt="" src="https://sharedat.net/f/Ce/CeBw9/microsoft-password-policy.png" width="320" height="192" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Microsoft Live password policy</figcaption></figure>
<p>Setting a maximum password length of 16 characters sets off a red flag for me. So I went looking for references to the Microsoft Live password policy. I eventually found one at <a href="http://help.outlook.com/en-gb/140/cc540536.aspx">http://help.outlook.com/en-gb/140/cc540536.aspx</a> &#8211; here are the rules and restrictions (emphasis is mine):</p>
<blockquote><p>Password rules</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The password can have a maximum length of 16 characters.</strong></li>
<li>The password is case-sensitive.</li>
<li>The password can contain uppercase letters and lowercase letters.</li>
<li>The password can contain numbers.</li>
<li>The password can contain the following ASCII text characters: ` ~ ! @ # $ % ^ &amp; * ( ) _ + &#8211; = { } | [ ]  : &#8221; ; &#8216; &lt; &gt; ? , . /</li>
</ul>
<p>Password restrictions<br />
<strong>The password can&#8217;t contain any of the following items:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Spaces</li>
<li>Non-English characters</li>
<li>The account name part of the email address. For example, if the email address is user@contoso.com, the password can&#8217;t contain user. This restriction isn&#8217;t case-sensitive. Therefore, USER or User can&#8217;t be used in the password for user@contoso.com.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>This raises the concern that perhaps Microsoft Live is storing plain text copies of passwords instead of the hash of the password. It would be completely foolish of them to store the plain text version of passwords, with serious security implications, so I hope that isn&#8217;t the case.</p>
<p>But if they really are hashing the passwords, why set a maximum length of 16 characters (and no spaces)? I could understand not allowing for infinitely long passwords, after all even bcrypt only supports unique strings up to 72 characters, but 16 seems particularly small in todays world of password managers. Why not something more sensible like 50 or 60?</p>
<p>Sadly none of this is new, it has had plenty of attention from <a href="http://arstechnica.com/security/2012/09/secret-microsoft-policy-limited-hotmail-passwords-to-16-characters/">Ars Technica</a>, <a href="http://thenextweb.com/microsoft/2012/09/21/this-ridiculous-microsoft-longer-accepts-long-passwords-shortens/">The Next Web</a>, and <a href="http://security.stackexchange.com/questions/20586/why-does-microsoft-limit-password-length">security.stackexchange.com</a>. Most of them point back to a <a href="http://blogs.windows.com/windows_live/b/windowslive/archive/2012/07/15/keeping-your-microsoft-account-more-secure.aspx">Microsoft blog post on &#8216;Keeping your Microsoft account more secure&#8217;</a>. The only really useful bit in the context of 16 character password limits comes from a comment by Eric Doerr (the author of the post):</p>
<blockquote><p>
Password length &#8211; We are working on increasing this. Unfortunately, for historical reasons, the password validation logic is decentralized across different products, so it&#8217;s a bigger change than it should be and takes longer to get to market. It&#8217;s also worth noting that the vast majority of compromised accounts are through malware and phishing. The small fraction of brute force is primarily common passwords like &#8220;123456&#8221; not due to a lack of complexity.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Most of these posts seem to be missing the issue of what happens when/if their password database is compromised and copied by an intruder? Under that situation there is going to be a world of difference between people who use 8 character passwords and people who use 30 character passwords.</p>
<p>And when it comes to trying to sync password authentication against multiple types of systems it raises the concern of plain text passwords again.  Even though Ars Technica asked about, Microsoft never really answered:</p>
<blockquote><p>
The spokeswoman&#8217;s response appears to indicate Microsoft engineers don&#8217;t store passwords in plaintext, although the spokeswoman didn&#8217;t address that issue despite Ars specifically asking about it.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Another method they might be using is regular encryption, instead of a hash.  So when a password needs to be a synced out to another service they decrypt the password and then encrypt it again on the new service.  That still isn&#8217;t as good as password hashing, but it would be better than storing the plain text version.</p>
<p>None of this fills me with warm fuzzies about how Microsoft Live is storing passwords.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday marked the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2011/03/14/ie9-release-globally-available-for-consumers-and-businesses.aspx">official release of IE9 from Microsoft</a>.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m very curious to see what sort of impact (or lack there of) that this will have on the browser field.  The key point is that IE9 does not support Windows XP.  That is a big deal for a few different reasons.</p>
<p>Using that numbers available at <a href="http://gs.statcounter.com/">gs.statcounter.com</a> the <a href="http://gs.statcounter.com/#os-ww-monthly-201012-201102">worldwide OS breakdown for Dec 10 -> Feb 11</a> is:</p>
<figure style="width: 620px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" alt="" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/_7O62-xwgnLw/TX-QhHvITjI/AAAAAAAAACM/rnJw4wSqNlk/gs-statcounter-os-world.png" title="OS versions" width="620" height="408" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">OS versions</figcaption></figure>
<p>That is Windows XP at 48%, Windows 7 at 29%, and Windows Vista at 14%.  That puts total Windows share at 91%, unfortunately only 43% are actually able to upgrade to IE9.  More than half of the current Windows users have no way to upgrade to IE9.</p>
<p>Next up is the IE6 issue, a browser that everyone loves to hate.  Even <a href="http://josephscott.org/archives/2011/03/ie6-countdown/">Microsoft doesn&#8217;t want people to use it anymore</a>.  The release of IE9 does absolutely nothing to reduce the number of IE6 users out there.  Why?  Because the only versions of Windows that IE9 supports, Vista and 7, never shipped with IE6.  Windows Vista shipped with IE7 and Windows 7 shipped with IE8.</p>
<figure style="width: 620px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" alt="" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/_7O62-xwgnLw/TX-XBru1BKI/AAAAAAAAACU/AqsZAzzY8_M/gs-statcounter-browser-versions.png" title="Browser versions" width="620" height="405" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Browser versions</figcaption></figure>
<p>IE6 is listed as the 5th most popular browser version is use.  Starting from the top: IE8 at 30%, Firefox 3.6 at 25%, Chrome 9 at 12%, IE7 at 10%, and IE6 at 4%.</p>
<p>If we want to reduce IE6 usage in the world the focus has to be on getting people to switch to a completely different browser.  Pushing IE7 or IE8 as options for those Windows XP users isn&#8217;t good either, since neither of them support <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Name_Indication">TLS server name identification</a>.  For Windows XP users you are best served by moving to either <a href="http://www.google.com/chrome/intl/en/landing_chrome_mac.html?hl=en">Google Chrome</a> or <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/">Mozilla Firefox</a>.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[&#160; The Mozilla Weave project released version 0.3 recently and their logo looked really familiar. Perhaps it was the long lost brother of the Microsoft BackOffice logo?

<p>The <a href="http://labs.mozilla.com/projects/weave/">Mozilla Weave</a> project released <a href="http://labs.mozilla.com/2009/03/weave-03-released/">version 0.3</a> recently and their logo looked really familiar.  Perhaps it was the long lost brother of the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/PRODUCTS/servers/designed/">Microsoft BackOffice</a> logo?</p>
<p>Maybe it&#8217;s just because I worked in an IT department many years ago where that BackOffice logo seemed to be everywhere, but I can&#8217;t look at that Weave logo without thinking of BackOffice.  It&#8217;s like a shiny monochrome version of Microsoft&#8217;s rainbow.</p>
<p>What do you think, definite relation, or am I just scarred from my time with Microsoft BackOffice all those years ago?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Earlier this month Microsoft contributed a <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/sql/technologies/php/default.mspx">SQL Server Driver for PHP</a>.  They even have a <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/sqlphp/">SQL Server and PHP blog</a> and their <a href="http://forums.microsoft.com/MSDN/ShowForum.aspx?ForumID=87&amp;SiteID=1">SQL Server forum</a> now lists as PHP in their client list.  The blog has an interesting post on <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/sqlphp/archive/2007/10/11/transparency-in-the-design-process.aspx">development of the driver</a>.</p>
<p>So, what does this thing do?  It is for PHP5 only (not a big deal considering PHP4 will only be getting security updates after this year) on Windows (this part is a bummer, but not surprising) to access SQL Server 2000 and 2005 (anyone running anything older than that in production?).</p>
<p>You could work with SQL Server from PHP prior to this using <a href="http://www.freetds.org/">FreeTDS</a>.  I&#8217;ve used the <a href="http://php.net/mssql">mssql_* PHP functions</a> backed by FreeTDS on FreeBSD for years so this new driver from Microsoft isn&#8217;t a major game changer at this point.</p>
<p>That said, I find this a pretty exciting development.</p>
<p>Microsoft is actually providing a PHP library to work with some of their own software.  I think that is great, although the really huge win would have been if it was available for non-Microsoft operating systems.  This is great stuff though, not just talk, but real live code.  Combining this with <a href="http://joseph.randomnetworks.com/archives/2007/09/24/php-on-iis/">better PHP on IIS support</a> I have a glimmer of hope that we&#8217;ll see more good things from Microsoft for PHP.</p>
<p>There has been plenty of PR about Microsoft doing more in this area, but providing real code and tools is what we actually need.</p>
