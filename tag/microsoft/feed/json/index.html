I consider that particular combination one of the most under rated technology stacks around.</p>\n<p>If you were heavy into all the microservices talk during 2015 then Lua+Nginx is an exciting combination.

Flash First Video Becomes Shameful</h4>\n<p>We have pretty good support for the <a href=\"http://caniuse.com/#feat=video\">video element</a>, it is time to move Flash for video to a <a href=\"http://docs.webplatform.org/wiki/html/elements/video#Flash_fallback\">fallback</a> position.  You are probably already doing that for mobile devices, time to go all in.</p>\n<h4>4. More Open Source From Microsoft</h4>\n<p>Microsoft has started to gain back some geek cred with their push into making more of their code open source ( check out <a href=\"https://github.com/Microsoft\">https://github.com/Microsoft</a> ).  My prediction is they go even further, announcing one of their larger key products will go open source.  The big bets would be Exchange or SQL Server.

Strange U.S. Presidential Politics</h4>\n<p>If you&#8217;d asked about this a year ago, I would have focused on how much I&#8217;m not keen on family dynasties for President.  At the time Jeb Bush and Hillary Clinton were safe bets on being the candidates from their respective parties.  One had a brother and father who were President, the other a husband.
