										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week <a href='http://googlefiberblog.blogspot.com/2015/03/google-fiber-is-coming-to-salt-lake-city.html'>Google Fiber announced they are coming to Salt Lake City</a>.  It looks like this is going to be a new fiber network, built from scratch.  That is significantly different from the Google Fiber in Provo, which was done by purchasing an existing network.</p>
<p>Unfortunately there is no fiber run to my house, and as far as I know there are no plans for it in the future.  There are really only two options: CenturyLink and Comcast.  For my location CenturyLink offers a maximum speed of 12Mbps down, which is usable, but not great.  Under the <a href="http://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-finds-us-broadband-deployment-not-keeping-pace">new FCC guidelines</a> that isn&#8217;t even considered broadband.</p>
<p>Comcast does provide 50 &#8211; 100Mbps down connections.  Unfortunately that means there is effectively only one broadband connection option.</p>
<p>At this point with Google Fiber already in Provo, and Google Fiber going into Salt Lake City, they may as well build out the area between the two <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="ðŸ™‚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
