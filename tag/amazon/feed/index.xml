<p>Twitter is still loosing money, but it is loosing a lot less than it was before.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t realize that Netflix was so low on the number of employees, yet their revenue is in the general ball park of much larger companies.  To the studios it must look like Netflix is over there printing money.  No wonder so many other companies want to start their own streaming content service.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The official description for <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/">Amazon Aurora</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Amazon Aurora is a MySQL-compatible, relational database engine that combines the speed and availability of high-end commercial databases with the simplicity and cost-effectiveness of open source databases.
</p></blockquote>
<p>This video provides more details:</p>
<a href="/2015/12/30/amazon-rds-for-aurora/"><img src="/wp-content/plugins/wp-youtube-lyte/lyteCache.php?origThumbUrl=%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FCwWFrZGMDds%2Fhqdefault.jpg" alt="YouTube Video"></a><br /><br /></p>
<p>Looking at all this I&#8217;m reminded of something I wrote back in April 2008: <a href="https://josephscott.org/archives/2008/04/sun-should-be-in-the-consumer-cloud-services-business/">Sun Should Be in the Consumer Cloud Services Business</a> ( this was a few months after Sun purchased MySQL and before Oracle purchased Sun ):</p>
<blockquote><p>
What I’d like to see from Sun is a MySQL cloud service that works just like your current MySQL server(s), only better. It should scale such that I don’t have to worry about performance and replicate data sufficiently that I’ll always have access to my data. There’s no need for a new API, since MySQL already supports network connectivity.
</p></blockquote>
<p>It feels like Amazon was aiming for the same thing with Aurora.  The rest, as they say, is history.</p>

<p>At $5 the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/b/?node=10667898011&#038;lo=digital-text">dash buttons</a> are a cheap experiment.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The video on <a href='http://cvg.ethz.ch/mobile/'>mobile phone 3D scanning</a> is clearly just the beginning.  It isn&#8217;t hard to imagine that 3D scanning via a mobile device will continue to get better.  For that matter how long until even more hardware constrained devices like Google Glass are able to do decent 3D scanning?</p>
<p>The obvious tie to 3D scanning is then being able to reproduce that thing with 3D printing.  At the low end there are a number of 3D printers available that people will use at home, but right now I don&#8217;t find that super compelling at scale.  A higher end consumer service that would be able to keep up with the type of demand generated by every mobile phone being able to 3D scan an object is much more interesting.</p>
<p>A higher quality large scale 3D printing operation could bring in additional capabilities, like a broader range of materials and a faster turn around time.</p>
<p>All of this gets me wondering what companies are in a good position to take advantage of this.  Amazon feels like a natural fit, a company that isn&#8217;t shy about tech and already ships packages all over.  What Amazon lacks is the immediate satisfaction vector.  Ideally I&#8217;d like to send off my 3D print request then go pick it up later the same day, perhaps even paying more for a faster turn around time.  That leads me to companies with a decent number of existing stores.  Walmart is the giant there, and certainly has the reach to pull something like that off.  But it doesn&#8217;t match well with their generally low end price range.</p>
<p>The company I find most interesting to pull off a large scale high quality 3D printing service is Home Depot.  They don&#8217;t have the delivery capabilities of Amazon or the massive store count of Walmart, but they strike the right balance with existing customers.  There are enough Home Depot locations to have a decent reach and people already come into their stores often looking for odds and ends, while at the same time having no problem spending money on bigger ticket items.</p>
<p>One area that I think a 3D printing service at Home Depot could really shine is the in between part level.  It isn&#8217;t uncommon to need a small replacement part for something that is only sold as part of a much larger thing.  But you don&#8217;t want to buy the larger component, just the small piece that is broken.  At that point Home Depot could just print one for you.</p>
<p>Then there is the whole world of custom designed one off parts that Home Depot would then be able to attract.  Printing things that haven&#8217;t existed before, or at least not in large numbers.</p>
<p>Executing on this idea wouldn&#8217;t be easy, that is also exactly why Home Depot should do it.  The economics will be against you at first, but by getting in sooner rather than later Home Depot would gain the experience necessary to figure out how to make the economics work.</p>

<p>Some have suggested that it isn&#8217;t even a real project, but simply a marketing ploy to get more attention for Amazon.</p>
<p>I agree it doesn&#8217;t seem to fit into historical methods for Amazon announcing new services.  At the same time I find it hard to bet against Jeff Bezos.</p>

Although not specifically mentioned in the release announcement you can verify this in the Custom Origins Appendix of the CloudFront Developer Guide. CloudFront will now forward the Accept-Encoding HTTP header to your origin server where you can ensure the appropriate content is served based on the supported encodings. CloudFront will then cache multiple versions of this content, the uncompressed version and the gzipped version and serve these to clients depending on the value of their Accept-Encoding header for all future requests.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here are two sets of net income numbers for the first two quarters of 2010:</p>
<p>A: $299M / $206M<br />
B: $310M / $213M</p>
<p>What two companies would you guess this information belonged to?  I&#8217;ll give you a hint, they are both tech (web) companies.  They&#8217;ve both been around for more than a decade.</p>
<p>Still not enough?  Alright, the two companies are Yahoo and Amazon.  Now, which set of numbers belongs to which company?  Enough with the suspense, the answer is <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q/is?s=AMZN">Amazon is set A</a> and <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q/is?s=YHOO">Yahoo is set B</a>.  Surprised?  Yeah, so was I.  Who knew that the net income of Yahoo was larger than that of Amazon for the first half of 2010?</p>
<p>Yahoo has become an easy target to beat up on.  As an outsider looking at the numerous reports of how Yahoo is dead I was surprised to see they make a profit at all.  Granted the &#8216;Net Income&#8217; line on an income statement isn&#8217;t the whole story of a company, so here are a few more.  Yahoo is much more efficient at generating a net income as a percentage of revenue compared to Amazon.  For 2009 Yahoo&#8217;s net income was <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q/is?s=YHOO&#038;annual">$597M on $6,460M in revenue</a>.  Amazon&#8217;s net income was significantly higher at <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q/is?s=AMZN&#038;annual">$902M, but that was on $24,509M in revenue</a>.  As a percentage that&#8217;s a hefty difference (9.2% vs. 3.6%).</p>
<p>I think few people would rate Yahoo above Amazon though, at least based on general perception of how the two companies are doing.  The bottom line?  Yahoo just isn&#8217;t cool.  This led me to the question, what is the cost of not being cool for a company?</p>
<p>Paul Graham recently wrote about <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/yahoo.html">his impression about what was wrong at Yahoo</a> and Michael Arrington <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/09/16/yahoos-three-year-plan-1-billion-users-and-10-billion-in-revenue/">wasn&#8217;t impressed with Yahoo&#8217;s three year plan</a>.  I still remember Yahoo as a search company, one I have long since left.  That said, I have a Flickr account that I generally enjoy (I have a few complaints, but I have at least a few complaints on nearly every web service I&#8217;ve ever used).  On the flip side, I have a Delicious account that I haven&#8217;t touched in years.</p>
<p>All of this discussion is only worth while if you ask the hard questions though.  If you were in charge at Yahoo what would you do to help turn improve things?  Both the perception of the company (uncool) and performance (flat, or dropping).</p>
<p>I think the first thing on my list would be to make some serious commitments to their developer community.  With the search back end being replaced by Bing many of their APIs were given end of life dates.  This makes developers hesitant to trust that you won&#8217;t pull the carpet out from under them again.</p>
<p>Next would be to beef up execution of current and new products.  It is no secret that a number of people have left Yahoo in the last years or so.  Time to re-focus those that are still there and bring in any needed new talent to make things top notch.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll be honest, looking out towards the future I&#8217;d like to see Yahoo do well.  I&#8217;m not convinced that is how things will turn out, but I think it is possible and I wish them the best of luck at making it happen.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Amazon recently announced support for <a href="http://aws.typepad.com/aws/2010/05/amazon-rds-multi-az-deployment.html">multi-zone MySQL instances with automatic failover</a>.  The general idea is that Amazon will make the on demand MySQL service they offer more fault tolerant, which is a wonderful thing to have.  It&#8217;s not there yet, but being able to send reads to another replicated server MySQL instance is on the future feature list.  When <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/rds/">Amazon Relation Database Service (RDS)</a> was announced it was clear that Amazon was going to continue building out core infrastructure services, so these additional high availability options are nice to see, but not a huge surprise.</p>
<p>As happy as I am to see Amazon doing this, my general feeling is one of disappointment that <a href="http://sun.com/">Sun</a> didn&#8217;t do more in this area when they purchased <a href="http://mysql.com/">MySQL</a>.  Not long after the Sun/MySQL deal I wrote <a href="http://joseph.randomnetworks.com/archives/2008/04/28/sun-should-be-in-the-consumer-cloud-services-business/">Sun Should Be in the Consumer Cloud Services Business</a>.  My thought was that Sun should offer an EC2/S3 style pay as you go service for MySQL.  And it should be open to anyone with a credit card, making this basically a consumer play, but could be used by big companies as well.</p>
<p>Now Sun and MySQL are in the hands of <a href="http://www.oracle.com/">Oracle</a>.  The opportunity for Oracle to offer a similar service is still there, but I see it as being even less likely now than when it was just Sun+MySQL.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s surprising to me to see capable companies you might normally think of as being in the best position to offer these types of services continue to let Amazon run further and further ahead of the pack.</p>
