The general idea is that Amazon will make the on demand MySQL service they offer more fault tolerant, which is a wonderful thing to have.  It&#8217;s not there yet, but being able to send reads to another replicated server MySQL instance is on the future feature list.  When <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/rds/\">Amazon Relation Database Service (RDS)</a> was announced it was clear that Amazon was going to continue building out core infrastructure services, so these additional high availability options are nice to see, but not a huge surprise.</p>\n<p>As happy as I am to see Amazon doing this, my general feeling is one of disappointment that <a href=\"http://sun.com/\">Sun</a> didn&#8217;t do more in this area when they purchased <a href=\"http://mysql.com/\">MySQL</a>.  Not long after the Sun/MySQL deal I wrote <a href=\"http://joseph.randomnetworks.com/archives/2008/04/28/sun-should-be-in-the-consumer-cloud-services-business/\">Sun Should Be in the Consumer Cloud Services Business</a>.  My thought was that Sun should offer an EC2/S3 style pay as you go service for MySQL.

            "content_text": "Amazon recently announced support for multi-zone MySQL instances with automatic failover.  The general idea is that Amazon will make the on demand MySQL service they offer more fault tolerant, which is a wonderful thing to have.  It&#8217;s not there yet, but being able to send reads to another replicated server MySQL instance is on the future feature list.  When Amazon Relation Database Service (RDS) was announced it was clear that Amazon was going to continue building out core infrastructure services, so these additional high availability options are nice to see, but not a huge surprise.\nAs happy as I am to see Amazon doing this, my general feeling is one of disappointment that Sun didn&#8217;t do more in this area when they purchased MySQL.
