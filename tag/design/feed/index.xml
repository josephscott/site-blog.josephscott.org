										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There is a great story about <a href="https://medium.com/p/7c03a9274f9">how they crafted the link underlines on Medium</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>
This is a story on how a quick evening project to fix the appearance of underlined Medium links turned into a month-long endeavour.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I kinda wish they&#8217;d have the same experience in creating a clean and useful structure for the URLs on Medium.  A post URL of <code>https://medium.com/p/7c03a9274f9</code> leaves me with no clue about what is there or how it relates to anything else on the site.  Author URLs like <code>https://medium.com/@mwichary</code> with that <code>@</code> are awkward in the same way that <code>https://plus.google.com/+ThomAllen</code> is with the <code>+</code> in the middle.</p>
<p>Instead the URLs on Medium are simple, in that they usually have very few components, but they aren&#8217;t what I&#8217;d consider clean and useful.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From the <a href="http://alistapart.com/article/flat-ui-and-forms">Flat UI and Forms post at A List APart</a> by Jessica Enders:</p>
<blockquote><p>
The problem is that in the push for simplicity, flat UIs may have gone too far. With content, things like drop shadows, gradients, and borders may well be no more than useless “embellishments.” When we read a multi-page news article, it doesn’t matter much whether the mechanism to move to the next page is a button or a link. With forms, however, distinguishing between a button and a link matters far more.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I am not a fan of pushing all design elements to be flat.  When we use the same design style for all elements then the distinct features between different groups of elements is lost.  One major victim of this is are forms and buttons.</p>
<p>We don&#8217;t do this in real life for the most part because it would only result in more confusion.  Imagine if we designed door knobs to be exactly the same as the door itself.  Instead of being able to easily identify where the door handle is, almost without thinking about it, each door would be a unique challenge in discovery because there would be no normal design clues that separate the knob from the rest of the door.</p>
<p>Making everything flat is the opposite of the <a href="http://www.sensible.com/dmmt.html">don&#8217;t make me think</a> approach to making things easier for people using your site.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I came across <a href="http://www.nuchi.acm.org/">NUCHI</a>, The Northern Utah chapter of the Association of Computing Machinery&#8217;s (ACM) Special Interest Group on Computer-Human Interaction (SIGCHI), at <a href="http://northtemple.com/820">NorthTemple</a>.  I&#8217;ve come across several passionate WordPress users, so I thought this would be an interesting to hear about.  Here are my quick notes from the presentation given by Xinru Page:</p>
<ul>
<li>How we make decisions</li>
<li>Processing: Visceral (attractiveness), Behavioral (functions, performance, usability), Reflective (self-image, meaning)</li>
<li>Product packaging</li>
<li>Baby face bias</li>
<li>Changing something people are already familiar with</li>
<li>Apple, Scoble&#8217;s iPhone Dev Camp video</li>
</ul>
<p>Funny how we are attracted to things, not necessarily based on functionality, but how we feel about it.</p>
<p>Here are some of the general conversation issues that got brought up:</p>
<ul>
<li>You don&#8217;t want medical devices to be hard to use or understand</li>
<li>Must have features, feature where more is better, and excitement features</li>
<li>The joy of inefficiency</li>
<li>Changing patterns (especially repetition) disrupts thought</li>
<li>Just because you can do something, you don&#8217;t have to do it</li>
<li>Right technology for the right crowd</li>
</ul>
<p>So how do we design web sites the evoke these types positive emotional responses?</p>
