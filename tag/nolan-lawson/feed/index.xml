										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Asynchronous JavaScript is not easy.  There has been a strong push towards <a href="http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/es6/promises/">promises</a> ( hello ES6! ).  Unfortunately they also introduce some new side effects, which may not be immediately obvious.  Nolan Lawson covers a number of these in <a href="http://pouchdb.com/2015/05/18/we-have-a-problem-with-promises.html">We have a problem with promises</a>.</p>
<p>In the end:</p>
<blockquote><p>
That being said, promises aren&#8217;t perfect. It&#8217;s true that they&#8217;re better than callbacks, but that&#8217;s a lot like saying that a punch in the gut is better than a kick in the teeth. Sure, one is preferable to the other, but if you had a choice, you&#8217;d probably avoid them both.</p>
<p>While superior to callbacks, promises are still difficult to understand and error-prone, as evidenced by the fact that I felt compelled to write this blog post. Novices and experts alike will frequently mess this stuff up, and really, it&#8217;s not their fault. The problem is that promises, while similar to the patterns we use in synchronous code, are a decent substitute but not quite the same.
</p></blockquote>
<p>If you are in the world of JavaScript callbacks and promises, you&#8217;ll really want to check out <a href="http://pouchdb.com/2015/03/05/taming-the-async-beast-with-es7.html">Taming the asynchronous beast with ES7</a> ( also by Nolan Lawson ).</p>
<p>Going to ES7 brings async and await ( hopefully ).  Being able to write code that conceptually looks synchronous is very appealing:</p>
<p>[sourcecode lang=&#8221;javascript&#8221;]<br />
let db = new PouchDB(&#8216;mydb&#8217;);<br />
try {<br />
  let result = await db.post({});<br />
  let doc = await db.get(result.id);<br />
  console.log(doc);<br />
} catch (err) {<br />
  console.log(err);<br />
}<br />
[/sourcecode]</p>
<p>This of course introduces yet another set of issues that you have to be aware of.  That said, this feels like the right direction.</p>
