Recent versions of WordPress have added support to allow wp-config.php and wp-content to live outside of the WordPress directory.  Here&#8217;s the steps to make your setup work as a Subversion check out (based on Sam&#8216;s WordPress Plus Subversion slides) in a subdirectory:\n\nAssumptions:\n\nDomain is example.com\nInstalling in root directory of the domain: /home/example.com/public_html/\nWeb server and MySQL database/username already setup and working correctly\n\n\ncd /home/example.com/public_html/\nmkdir wp\nsvn co http://svn.automattic.com/wordpress/branches/2.7/ wp (could be any branch, tag or -trunk)\nInstall WordPress at http://example.com/wp/\nmv wp/wp-config.php wp-config.php (moves wp-config.php from /home/example.com/public_html/wp/ to /home/example.com/public_html/)\nmkdir wp-content\n\nAdd WP_CONTENT_DIR and WP_CONTENT_URL after WP_LANG to wp-config.php:\n[sourcecode language=&#8221;php&#8221;]\n&#8230;\ndefine (&#8216;WPLANG&#8217;, &#8221;);\ndefine( &#8216;WP_CONTENT_DIR&#8217;, dirname( ABSPATH ) . &#8216;/wp-content&#8217; );\ndefine( &#8216;WP_CONTENT_URL&#8217;, &#8216;http://example.com/wp-content&#8217; );\n/* That&#8217;s all, stop editing! Happy blogging. */\n&#8230;\n[/sourcecode]\n\ncd wp-content\nmkdir plugins\ncd plugins\nln -s ../../wp/wp-content/plugins/akismet .\ncd ..\nmkdir themes\ncd themes\nln -s ../../wp/wp-content/themes/default .\nUpdate WordPress settings in wp-admin:\n\nSettings -&gt; General -&gt; WordPress address (URL): http://example.com/wp/\nSettings -&gt; General -&gt; Blog address (URL): http://example.com/\n\n\nPermalinks:\n\nSettings -&gt; Permalinks -&gt; Custom Structure: /archives/%year%/%monthnum%/%postname%/ (my preferred format, you can choose your own if you&#8217;d like)\n.htaccess:\n[sourcecode language=&#8221;php&#8221;]\nRewriteEngine On\nRewriteBase /\nRewriteRule ^wp/wp-content/(.*)$ wp-content/$1 [R=301,L]\nRewriteRule ^wp-admin/(.*)$ wp/wp-admin/$1 [R=301,L]\nRewriteRule ^$ /wp/index.php [L]\nRewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f\nRewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d\nRewriteRule . /wp/index.php [L]\n[/sourcecode]\n\n\n\n\nYou can update WordPress at any time by running &#8216;svn up&#8217; in /home/example.com/public_html/wp/.  Updating when a new major release comes out means switching branches, for 2.8 that would &#8216;svn switch http://svn.automattic.com/wordpress/branches/2.8/&#8217;.\nWhen logging in remember that wp-admin is at http://example.com/wp/wp-admin/.\nI&#8217;ve also run into a few plugins that need fixing, because they lookup the WP URL via get_bloginfo( &#8216;wpurl&#8217; ) instead of get_bloginfo( &#8216;home&#8217; ).  The problem with &#8216;wpurl&#8217; is it returns http://example.com/wp/, making it reference the wp-content directory that came with WordPress (http://example.com/wp/wp-content/) instead of the one that you are actually using at http://example.com/wp-content/.  The wp-content redirect in the .htaccess file should help make this a bit less painful by redirecting /wp/wp-content/ requests to /wp-content/.\nIf you&#8217;ve setup /home/example.com/public_html/ as it&#8217;s own Subversion repository you can make WordPress an external for the /home/example.com/public_html/wp/ directory.  That way you&#8217;ll still be able to have a pristine setup of WordPress while being able to manage wp-config.php, themes and plugins in your own repository.",
