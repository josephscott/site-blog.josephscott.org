										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the tech/geek crowd there are 3 movies that stand above the rest.  Here they are in chronological order:</p>
<h3>TRON &#8211; 1982</h3>
<p>A resourceful hacker breaks into a mainframe to find information that will prove his side of the story.  The bulk of the movie is spent visualizing a world inside the computer, where programs live out their brief lives.  With a strong emphasis on video games this movie appealed to many of the kids fascinated with the machines that populated arcades every where.  This movie was more about the fantasy of the computer world than trying to give a reasonable portrayal of how things really were.</p>
<p>It was one of the earliest films to make use of computer graphics, along with The Last Starfighter in 1984.  Such special effects, common place today, were a big deal at the time.</p>
<h3>WarGames &#8211; 1983</h3>
<p>A computer savvy high school student starts out by changing his grades and ends up in a military simulation for nuclear war while searching for new games to play.  The main character, David Lightman, helped solidify the view of computer hacker teens as socially awkward and misunderstood by those in authority.</p>
<p>The term &#8216;war dialer&#8217;, where a computer program calls phone numbers automatically looking for other computers, was coined from the dialer program shown in the movie.  With the wide spread use of wifi the term &#8216;war driving&#8217; is a modern day version of same phrase.</p>
<h3>Sneakers &#8211; 1992</h3>
<p>A team that specializes in testing security systems gets in over their heads.  This movie has a little bit of everything; cryptography, conspiracies, phreaking, social engineering, politics, break ins and a blind man driving a van.</p>
<p>The list of actors for this movie is impressive, combined with a fun story with plenty of twists.  To top it all off this is perhaps the most reasonable portrayal of the geek/tech scene of any mainstream film.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think that it&#8217;s coincidence that these movies are all before the popular adoption of the Internet.  With technology and computers being so integrated into the daily routine of so many it&#8217;s hard to make a modern film that shows their use in a story that doesn&#8217;t look exceedingly boring.  The result is tech/geek movies become more like action/adventure movies.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s your favorite tech/tech movie?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sarah and I went to see <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0348150/">Superman Returns</a> last Friday.  I really wanted to like this movie.  I&#8217;ve seen all the original Superman movies (yes even 3 and 4) and read my fair share of Superman comics as a kid.  Strangely enough, my biggest worry before seeing the movie was having <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0746125/">Brandon Routh</a> play Superman.  After seeing the movie though he turned out to be one of the better parts of the film.  I think he does a good job in the dual roles of Clark Kent and Superman, playing them very much in the same style as Reeve.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t have too many other positive things to say about this movie though.  To sum it up, I wasn&#8217;t thrilled with the story they tried to tell.  I felt like too much of it was very un-Superman like.  Just like Star Wars though, it really doesn&#8217;t matter how bad it is, you are still going to see it.  It is Superman after all.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve opted to not give specific details about my complaints because it would spoil the movie for those who haven&#8217;t seen it.  Besides, I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ll know what I&#8217;m talking about after you see it <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="ðŸ™‚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>2.5 out of 5 for a very un-Superman like story line.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When I was a kid going to the movies usually involved looking through the theater ads in the newspaper to see what double features were playing.  Just like today we complained about the price of a movie ticket and double features were usually a good deal.  Today I look at <a href="http://movies.yahoo.com/">movies.yahoo.com</a> instead of the newspaper to see what is playing, but I don&#8217;t remember the last time that I saw a double feature offered.</p>
<p>Are there just so many movies coming out that there aren&#8217;t enough screens available to make double features worthwhile for the theaters?  Maybe this is localized issue, perhaps California is just to busy for double features?  Or large city issue, where places like Sacramento might be more interested in getting as many movies out there as possible?  For Sacramento it seems like none of those should be problems, there are more than enough theaters in the region.  I can think of at least 6 that are a 20 minute drive or less from my home.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll guess that money is the driving force here, as it is in so many other things.  They probably discovered that people will still go to the theater to see movies even if they stop offering double features.</p>
