										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For a number of years I&#8217;ve been using a home grown bash script to manage my shell and dotfiles.  It was just enough to do the job, but it was never anything great ( not sure I&#8217;d even call it good ).</p>
<p>As 2019 was coming to a close, I started looking at alternatives to my ugly shell script.  There are several options out there, and the one I have settled on is <a href="https://yadm.io/">yadm</a>.</p>
<p>There are two features that have made using yadm a happy experience.  First, it is basically <a href="https://yadm.io/docs/getting_started#">a wrapper for Git</a>.  If you&#8217;ve used Git, then using yadm will immediately feel familiar.  Second, the built in <a href="https://yadm.io/docs/alternates#">alternate files</a> support.  I&#8217;ve only used it for separate Linux and Mac OS binaries, but that by itself makes the feature worth while.</p>
<p>Once <a href="https://yadm.io/docs/install">installed</a> you are only <a href="https://yadm.io/docs/getting_started">a few commands</a> away from starting a Git repo for your shell and dotfiles.</p>
