										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Remember all the way back to mid-January when I wrote about <a href="/2020/01/15/the-end-of-third-party-cookies-on-the-web/">The End Of Third Party Cookies On The Web</a>?  That was triggered by the <a href="https://blog.chromium.org/2020/01/building-more-private-web-path-towards.html">Google Chrome announcement that third-party cookies were going away in 2022</a>.  At the end I noted that I expected Safari would make a similar move, but sooner:</p>
<blockquote><p>
I wouldn’t be surprised if Safari comes out and says they are going to do the same thing. If they do, I would expect them to have an even more aggressive timeline. <strong>My guess: by the end of 2020</strong>.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Last week Safari announced that &#8220;<a href="https://webkit.org/blog/10218/full-third-party-cookie-blocking-and-more/">cookies for cross-site resources are now blocked by default across the board</a>&#8220;.  That change in defaults is part of the upgrade to Safari 13.1.</p>
<p>So yeah, definitely a more aggressive timeline.</p>
<p>Now some may respond with: so what, Chrome is the most popular browser in use today.  And they would be right.  What they would be missing is that <a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/browser-market-share/mobile/worldwide/#monthly-201903-202003">Safari has a nearly 25% share of the browser market on mobile devices</a>:</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/sc-mobile.png"><img loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/sc-mobile-1024x521.png" alt="" width="580" height="295" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-18155" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/sc-mobile-1024x521.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/04/sc-mobile-300x153.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/04/sc-mobile-768x391.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/04/sc-mobile-1536x781.png 1536w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/04/sc-mobile-2048x1042.png 2048w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/04/sc-mobile-1200x610.png 1200w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/04/sc-mobile-1980x1007.png 1980w" sizes="(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px" /></a></p>
<p>This move by Safari to start blocking third party cookies now is a big deal.  Combine that with Chrome doing the same thing in a few years means this is what the future of the web is going to look like.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was recently chatting with John Wilander ( <a href="https://twitter.com/johnwilander">@johnwilander</a> ) from the WebKit team at Apple about Safari ITP ( Intelligent Tracking Prevention ) and he mentioned something that has been really helpful:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Think of it as a per-page, per-frame thing
</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/safari-itp.png"><img loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/safari-itp.png" alt="" width="765" height="268" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-17873" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/safari-itp.png 765w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/12/safari-itp-300x105.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 765px) 100vw, 765px" /></a></p>
<p>The <a href="https://webkit.org/blog/8124/introducing-storage-access-api/">Storage Request Access API</a> has very specific conditions in relationship to ITP, and a whole section on when those permissions can be automatically removed.  That part is worth extra attention:</p>
<blockquote><p>
<strong>Access Removal</strong></p>
<p>Storage access is granted for the life of the document as long as the document’s frame is attached to the DOM. This means:</p>
<p>&#8211; Access is removed when the sub frame navigates.<br />
&#8211; Access is removed when the sub frame is detached from the DOM.<br />
&#8211; Access is removed when the top frame navigates.<br />
&#8211; Access is removed when the webpage goes away, such as a tab close.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Not much wiggle room there.</p>
<p>The mental model of &#8220;<strong>Safari ITP: per-page, per-frame</strong>&#8221; sums it up nicely.  Thank you <a href="https://twitter.com/johnwilander">@johnwilander</a>.</p>

		<title>New Safari ITP Debug Mode For MacOS 10.14 Mojave Too</title>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a write up about the <a href="https://webkit.org/blog/9521/intelligent-tracking-prevention-2-3/">Safari ITP ( Intelligent Tracking Prevention ) 2.3 update</a>, there is section that talks about changes to &#8220;ITP Debug Mode In Safari on macOS Catalina&#8221; ( Catalina is 10.15, if you, like me, can never remember which code name goes with which version ). I am still using MacOS ( writing it like macOS just looks wrong ) 10.14 Mojave, so I hadn&#8217;t worried about the details of those changes.</p>
<p>Well, turns out those debug changes are not limited to MacOS 10.15. I was running tests to duplicate a Safari ITP related issue and kept getting zero debug output. After tweaking my tests every way I could think of and still getting no debug output, I finally went back and re-read the <a href="https://webkit.org/blog/8387/itp-debug-mode-in-safari-technology-preview-62/">original Safari ITP Debug Mode documentation</a>, to make sure I hadn&#8217;t missed something.</p>
<p>Still nothing.</p>
<p>After more frustration I finally landed on the <a href="https://webkit.org/blog/9521/intelligent-tracking-prevention-2-3/">ITP 2.3 update post</a> and decided to try to the &#8220;ITP Debug Mode In Safari on macOS Catalina&#8221; on my MacOS 10.14 ( Mojava ) laptop. <strong>*POOF*</strong> &#8211; debug starting producing output again.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know why they indicate that this is specific to MacOS 10.15 ( Catalina ), because it isn&#8217;t. Here are the versions I&#8217;m running, using the new debug mode details:</p>
<p>&#8211; MacOS 10.14.6<br />
&#8211; Safari 13.0.3<br />
&#8211; Safari Technology Preview 95</p>
<p>For easy reference, the new command to see the ITP debug log is:</p>
<pre><code class="language-markup">log stream -info | grep ITPDebug</code></pre>
<p>Go read the <a href="https://webkit.org/blog/9521/intelligent-tracking-prevention-2-3/">ITP 2.3 post</a> for more details, other debug settings have changed too.</p>
