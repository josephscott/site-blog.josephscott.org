I&#8217;ve seen all the original Superman movies (yes even 3 and 4) and read my fair share of Superman comics as a kid.  Strangely enough, my biggest worry before seeing the movie was having <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0746125/\">Brandon Routh</a> play Superman.  After seeing the movie though he turned out to be one of the better parts of the film.  I think he does a good job in the dual roles of Clark Kent and Superman, playing them very much in the same style as Reeve.</p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t have too many other positive things to say about this movie though.  To sum it up, I wasn&#8217;t thrilled with the story they tried to tell.  I felt like too much of it was very un-Superman like.  Just like Star Wars though, it really doesn&#8217;t matter how bad it is, you are still going to see it.  It is Superman after all.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve opted to not give specific details about my complaints because it would spoil the movie for those who haven&#8217;t seen it.  Besides, I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ll know what I&#8217;m talking about after you see it <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f642.png\" alt=\"\ud83d\ude42\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /></p>\n<p>2.5 out of 5 for a very un-Superman like story line.</p>\n",
