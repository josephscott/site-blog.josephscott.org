            "content_text": "In a write up about the Safari ITP ( Intelligent Tracking Prevention ) 2.3 update, there is section that talks about changes to &#8220;ITP Debug Mode In Safari on macOS Catalina&#8221; ( Catalina is 10.15, if you, like me, can never remember which code name goes with which version ). I am still using MacOS ( writing it like macOS just looks wrong ) 10.14 Mojave, so I hadn&#8217;t worried about the details of those changes.\nWell, turns out those debug changes are not limited to MacOS 10.15. I was running tests to duplicate a Safari ITP related issue and kept getting zero debug output. After tweaking my tests every way I could think of and still getting no debug output, I finally went back and re-read the original Safari ITP Debug Mode documentation, to make sure I hadn&#8217;t missed something.\nStill nothing.\nAfter more frustration I finally landed on the ITP 2.3 update post and decided to try to the &#8220;ITP Debug Mode In Safari on macOS Catalina&#8221; on my MacOS 10.14 ( Mojava ) laptop. *POOF* &#8211; debug starting producing output again.\nI don&#8217;t know why they indicate that this is specific to MacOS 10.15 ( Catalina ), because it isn&#8217;t. Here are the versions I&#8217;m running, using the new debug mode details:\n&#8211; MacOS 10.14.6\n&#8211; Safari 13.0.3\n&#8211; Safari Technology Preview 95\nFor easy reference, the new command to see the ITP debug log is:\nlog stream -info | grep ITPDebug\nGo read the ITP 2.3 post for more details, other debug settings have changed too.",
