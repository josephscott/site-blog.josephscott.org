										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Turns out there is a physical trait of identical twins that isn&#8217;t identical.  Fingerprints, <a href="http://qi.epfl.ch/en/sondage/show/257/">here is why</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Because fingerprints are influenced by environmental factors during intrauterine life.</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p>Although very similar, the fingerprints of identical twins are nevertheless unique because they are not completely determined by genetics: they are an example of phenotype, which refers to the physical characteristics of an individual that are determined by the interaction of genes and the environment.
</p></blockquote>
<p>The New York Times covered this back in <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/02/health/the-claim-identical-twins-have-identical-fingerprints.html?_r=0">2004</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
While a fetus is developing, the ridges along these patterns are influenced by a number of factors, including bone growth, pressures within the womb and contact with amniotic fluid.
</p></blockquote>
<p>For all the talk about how no two people have identical fingerprints, I hadn&#8217;t thought about the specific case of identical twins.  Are there any other physical tests that you can do to tell the difference between identical twins?</p>
