										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I went to see <a href="http://blog.guykawasaki.com/">Guy Kawasaki</a> give his Art of Innovation talk this afternoon.  <a href="http://www.windley.com/">Phil Windley</a> does a good job of covering the <a href="http://www.windley.com/archives/2007/11/guy_kawasaki_in_utah.shtml">core details of Guy&#8217;s talk</a>.</p>
<p>What Phil didn&#8217;t mention was that Guy didn&#8217;t turn off the <a href="http://twitter.com/">Twitter</a> app he was using on his Mac, so throughout his presentation in the upper right hand portion of the screen a tweet from the people he follows would show up and fade out.  The font was rather small so it was difficult to read, even on the massive projection screen.  That was rather fun to watch.</p>
<p>During the Q &amp; A at the end Guy mentioned that he didn&#8217;t need to make $2 billion off of Truemors.com, after all he&#8217;d only put in about $25,000 so far.  At that rate selling it for $50,000 would be doubling his money in 6 months.  This led to the very last question asked by a woman in the back (Allan&#8217;s wife, who&#8217;s name I don&#8217;t recall) saying if Guy wanted to sell she&#8217;d write him a $50,000 check.  Turns out she works for a investment fund or something, so in some respect she very well could have made good on the deal.  That helped end the event on a nice light hearted note.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://blog.guykawasaki.com/">Guy Kawasaki</a> brings out some interesting points about business.  <a href="http://blog.guykawasaki.com/2006/08/ten_things_to_l.html">Ten Things to Learn This School Year</a> picks on the general theme that what you learn in school is often completely opposite what is useful in business.  Some of these points are brought up in his <a href="http://blog.guykawasaki.com/2006/06/the_art_of_the_.html">Art of the Start</a> presentation.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been working on slides for a presentation at work and I&#8217;m trying to take Guy&#8217;s <a href="https://guykawasaki.com/the_102030_rule/">10/20/30 Rule of PowerPoint</a> to heart.  These are also covered in the Art of the Start talk as well.  I like the 30 point font rule.  As part of this I&#8217;ve been using <a href="http://gliffy.com/">Gliffy</a> for some of the diagrams in the presentation.  I&#8217;m not a heavy diagram user so I don&#8217;t have a detailed comparison of Gliffy versus Visio, but I will say that so far Gliffy has been a pleasure to use.</p>
