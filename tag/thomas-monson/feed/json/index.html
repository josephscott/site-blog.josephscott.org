The book fills in many more details and events that I wasn&#8217;t aware of though. </p>\n<p>This book was really enjoyable to read.  In many cases the historical context of the events played a major role, the trips to East Germany for instance.  I remember when the Berlin wall fell while I was in high school, but I&#8217;d forgotten that the <a href=\"http://lds.org/church/temples/freiberg-germany?lang=eng\">Freiberg, Germany temple</a> was actually built prior to that.  And I didn&#8217;t know that they&#8217;d gotten permission to send missionaries to and from Easy Germany before the fall of the wall.</p>\n<p>It has always been amazing to me that he has served in full time leadership of the church for so many years.  I can&#8217;t imagine how much of a sacrifice this must have been for his wife Frances.  I don&#8217;t see how either of their lives could ever be described as easy.</p>\n<p>Ultimately I give this book my highest praise: reading this book made me want to be a better person.</p>\n",
