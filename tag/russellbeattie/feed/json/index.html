Given that I use Windows, FreeBSD and Mac OS X on a daily basis I don&#8217;t really consider my self a zealot, but I&#8217;ll discuss his points anyway.  So you&#8217;ll know where I&#8217;m coming from the Apple systems that I use include a G4 PowerBook (for the last 18 months or so) and an Xserve + Xserve RAID server.  Although I have complaints about how I&#8217;d do things differently, that is true for Windows as well.  Overall I&#8217;ve found the systems to be stable and have worked well, although I don&#8217;t have nearly the array of mobile devices to test that Russ does.  About the only time I reboot is when an update requires me to.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>I personally have found to my OS X systems to be much closer in stability to FreeBSD (very good) than Windows (so so).  I can count the number of times my OS X systems have gone wacky on one hand over the last year and half.  I won&#8217;t dispute that Russ is having problems, but I can attest that that isn&#8217;t the case for everyone.</li>\n<li>I&#8217;ve had mixed feelings about this.  For instance Java tends to run much faster on my PowerBook than on my older Windows systems.  For recent (3+ Ghz) Windows systems it is probably a close tie.  This is kind of a toss up though, somethings certainly run faster on even older Windows systems, and other things run faster on my PowerBook.</li>\n<li>I don&#8217;t use my PowerBook for too many graphically intensive tasks (like games) so I don&#8217;t have much of a comparison there.</li>\n<li>For the most part I really like Mail, especially the ability to have a unified inbox across my IMAP accounts, I wish Thunderbird supported that for more than just POP3.  I like Firefox and Camino because of the community of plugins that are available.  But there is always one thing that I miss in Safari, built in spell check!  I know there are plugins for Firefox, but it just isn&#8217;t the same.  I tend to mostly use Safari and Camino with some Firefox thrown in.  When Firefox 1.5 becomes official I&#8217;m going to consider moving to only Firefox.</li>\n<li>Okay, I can not stand Windows thumbnails!  It drives me nuts.  It really gets me when it decides to automatically switch my view to thumbnail mode just because it found one jpeg in a directory full off hundreds of other files.  Arg!

There are some specific features in Finder that make me go duh, why doesn&#8217;t everybody do it this way?</li>\n<li>I&#8217;m not a big chatter, but I will go with Skype on this one.  I&#8217;ve used Fire and iChat and been okay with them too.</li>\n<li>Only spent a few minutes with Garageband, looks like it is extremely cool for folks into making music, but I&#8217;m not one of those.</li>\n<li>The built in screen shot feature uses PDF in OS X so I&#8217;m not sure what Russ is using that generates Quicktime tiffs.</li>\n<li>I&#8217;ve never used Keynote or Pages.</li>\n<li>This is a rather self serving argument, but it does have some validity.</li>\n<li>This depends on what &#8220;most stuff&#8221; is.
