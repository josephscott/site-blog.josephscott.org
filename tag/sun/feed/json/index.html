Nice, but not any where near what I&#8217;m hoping for.  So I started looking at the other side of the coin, what things are keeping Sun from being able to offer pay as you go consumer services?  One thing quickly came to mind: dealing with many payment transactions, often for small amounts.</p>\n<p>The beauty of pay as you go cloud services is that you pay for what you use.  If you only use a small amount, you only pay a small amount.  My S3 bill each month rarely goes over $5, because I only use it in small amounts.  Amazon charges my credit card and sends me an email with the details.  But for most companies doing lots of credit card transactions for small amounts simply isn&#8217;t worth it.  The fees associated with credit card transactions add up fast when dealing with such small transactions.  At least for most companies.</p>\n<p>Amazon has been doing large volumes of credit card transactions for a number of years, I&#8217;d be very surprised if they don&#8217;t have some custom fee structure for processing them.  When you do the volume of transactions that a company like Amazon does, that gives you a little more leverage.  So part of what has allowed Amazon to grow into the pay as go cloud services market is the fact that they already had a large payment system in place that allows them to process even fairly small transactions efficiently.</p>\n<p>This gives <a href=\"http://checkout.google.com/\">Google Checkout</a> an even more important role than just being a competitor to <a href=\"http://paypal.com/\">PayPal</a>.  With AdWords and AdSense already going, Google already has plenty of reason to want the same sort of leverage Amazon has for processing payments.  With Google App Engine expected to have a similar pay as go structure as AWS, there will be even more focus on processing small amounts without taking a big hit on fees.</p>\n<p>Now back to Sun.  As far as I know Sun has nothing that even comes close to Amazon&#8217;s volume of transactions or Google&#8217;s small fee services.  So they&#8217;ve had no reason to build up an efficient payment system that can handle small amounts.  This leaves them with two choices, build one to try and gain the needed leverage to reduce the fees involved, or partner with someone else who already has.  So far they&#8217;ve gone with the later, specifically Amazon and their EC2 service.</p>\n<p>One way around the small transaction amount problem is to have customers pay in advance.  Sun could still offer pay as you go services, but you have pay for them upfront in $100 increments.  Each month your usage fee would be deducted from the amount you already paid them.  If I only used $10 this month, I&#8217;d still have $90 left in my account.  This isn&#8217;t nearly as attractive from the small customer side as simply paying $10 per month from their credit card, but not horrendous either, especially if you could get the minimum pay in advance amount down to something under $50.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;d really like to see more competition in the cloud services space, but so far Amazon has it pretty much all to itself (which a small niche potentially going to Google App Engine).

The purchase price is $1 billion, $800 million cash, $200 million in options.  What is this going to mean for <a href=\"http://www.sun.com/software/products/postgresql/index.jsp\">Sun&#8217;s PostgreSQL development</a>?

And of course, what will this mean to the MySQL community?</p>\n<p>Now some of my own thoughts on this deal.  This seems like something of a desperate move for both companies.  In the case of MySQL, they need to find a way to stay intact as a company and bring in lots of cash.  Guess all that talk of an IPO goes out the window now.  So the list of potential buyers becomes pretty small.  It would have to be to a company with lots of hard core tech but without a major database platform of their own, which rules out Oracle, IBM and Microsoft.  Google and Yahoo might have smart folks who could make it better, but getting into the customer support business isn&#8217;t something that they&#8217;d want to do.  So how many other big tech companies are left that would be willing or able to pay the kind of money that MySQL was looking for?  Like I said, small list.</p>\n<p>Then there is the Sun side of this deal.  Recently Sun has been pushing PostgreSQL, but there isn&#8217;t one single company behind PostgreSQL, making it much more difficult to control in the manner that Sun prefers.  In this respect MySQL fits perfectly, although it is Open Source (mostly), there really isn&#8217;t much of a developer community for it.  Basically all development happens at MySQL the company.  This would allow Sun to have the same massive grip over development that it has had for its other open source products.  I think another factor is that Sun desperately wants to avoid becoming ignored in the world of big name web companies.  They&#8217;ve developed some great stuff (Dtrace, ZFS) and even open sourced their OS (Solaris), but have still have failed to get their foot in the door in any big way for tech startups.  So if you can&#8217;t convince them to like you, buy someone they already do.  And better to do it now while you still have the money to do so.</p>\n<p>Sun has just bought their way into becoming every tech company&#8217;s best friend.
