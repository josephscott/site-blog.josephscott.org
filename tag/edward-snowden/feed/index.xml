										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.npr.org/people/4080709/steve-inskeep">Steve Inskeep</a> on Edward Snowden during <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/id/53836204/ns/meet_the_press-transcripts/t/dec-paul-ryan-patty-murray-michael-hayden-bill-richardson-nancy-gibbs-kathleen-parker-steve-inskeep-scott-walker/">Meet The Press on 15 Dec 2013</a>, responding to Bill Richardson (emphasis is mine):</p>
<blockquote><p>
And I wonder if it&#8217;s possible to say that <strong>two things can be true simultaneously</strong>, Governor Richardson.  <strong>It may well be that Snowden was wrong, that he should be prosecuted, and that, at the same time, he did a necessary thing because this is the only way that we find out.</strong>  Even though members of Congress do have information, they respond to public pressure.  Public pressure only comes from public debates, and you only have a debate when you have someone who does something that is wrong, like Edward Snowden.
</p></blockquote>
<p>This may end up being the most useful and accurate way to describe Snowden and what he has done.</p>
<p>This description is all the more powerful since it came on the same day that <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/nsa-speaks-out-on-snowden-spying/">60 Minutes aired their NSA/Snowden piece</a>.  I was very disappointed in 60 Minutes on their NSA segment.  They had an opportunity to ask some tough questions that deserve answers, and they blew it.</p>
