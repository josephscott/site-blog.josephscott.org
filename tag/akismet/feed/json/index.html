When <a href=\"http://photomatt.net\">Matt</a> first announced this service I downloaded the <a href=\"http://akismet.com/download/\">WordPress Plugin</a> just to look through the code to see what the API looked like.</p>\n<p>My interest was rekindled with the <a href=\"http://akismet.com/blog/2005/12/python-and-api/\">announcement</a> of <a href=\"http://akismet.com/development/api/\">API docs</a> for Akismet.  The API is pretty simple (good) and called via <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer\">REST</a>.  Then I wandered over to their <a href=\"http://lists.automattic.com/mailman/listinfo/spam-stopper\">Spam Stopper</a> email list to see what sort items were being discussed.  One of the <a href=\"http://comox.textdrive.com/pipermail/spam-stopper/2005-December/000256.html\">first emails I came across</a> had a reasonable question:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\nThe API documentation says of the comment-check function :</p>\n<p>    &#8220;This call returns either &#8220;true&#8221; or &#8220;false&#8221; as the body content.&#8221;</p>\n<p>I have been assuming that &#8220;false&#8221; means the comment *is* spam &#8211; is this correct ?\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>I thought this was kind of odd, so I went back and checked the docs again.  Sure enough that was all the docs said about return values for comment-check.  Matt provided a <a href=\"http://comox.textdrive.com/pipermail/spam-stopper/2005-December/000257.html\">quick reply</a> though:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\nThat would be the problem. <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f642.png\" alt=\"\ud83d\ude42\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /></p>\n<p>True = this is spam<br />\nFalse = this is not spam\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>So the lesson learned here is to remember to document everything when it comes to your API.  This reminds me a something I read somewhere: don&#8217;t write so that you can be understood, write so that you can&#8217;t be missunderstood.</p>\n<p>None of this is meant as a strike against Matt, anything that helps reduce the amount spam going around is a good thing.  The docs were also listed as a first draft, so I&#8217;m sure they will get additional refinement as time goes on.</p>\n",
