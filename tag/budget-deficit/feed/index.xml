										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An op-ed piece in the New York Times by <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/16/opinion/krugman-moment-of-truthiness.html">Paul Krugman mentioned U.S. budget deficits</a> and their trends.  I&#8217;ve looked at the U.S. total federal debt ( <a href="https://josephscott.org/archives/2009/04/history-of-the-federal-debt/">History Of The Federal Debt</a> and <a href="https://josephscott.org/archives/2013/04/percentage-change-in-federal-debt-1958-2012/">Percentage Change in Federal Debt, 1958-2012</a> ) and this post by Mr. Krugman got me thinking about budget deficits.</p>
<p>Historical records for the U.S. federal budget, surpluses and deficits are available from <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/historicals">the Office of Management and Budget</a> site.  I downloaded <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/budget/fy2014/assets/hist01z1.xls">Table 1.1—Summary of Receipts, Outlays, and Surpluses or Deficits (-): 1789–2018</a>, a 39 KB Excel file.</p>
<p>Here are a few highlights of U.S. federal budget deficits and surpluses since 1900:</p>
<ul>
<li>From 1900 to 2012 there have been budget surpluses 31 times</li>
<li>From 1950 to 2012 there have been budget surpluses only 9 times</li>
<li>The largest single year surplus was in 1927, with a surplus of $1.155 billion ( billion, with a B! )</li>
<li>The largest deficit in a single year was 2009, with a monster deficit of $1.4 trillion ( with a T! )</li>
<li>There was a four year streak of budget surpluses from 1998 to 2001, the previous four year streak before that was all the back in the 1920s</li>
<li>Every year in the 1920s there was a budget surplus</li>
<li>The longest budget surplus streak was 1920 to 1930</li>
<li>The longest period without a surplus was 1970 to 1997</li>
<li>The first time the deficit exceeded one billion dollars was 1918, at $9 billion</li>
<li>The first time the deficit exceeded one hundred billion dollars was 1982, at $127.9 billion</li>
</ul>
<p>It has been 11 years since we last had a budget surplus. I hope that we don&#8217;t break the 1970 to 1997 streak for the longest period without a budget surplus.</p>
