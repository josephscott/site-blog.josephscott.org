										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It has come time to wrap up 2015.  So many highs and lows.  And while tomorrow is really just another day, there is comfort that comes from the idea of being able to start something new.</p>
<p>Tomorrow I&#8217;ll post a few hopes and predictions for 2016.  In the mean time here are my Akismet spam stats for the last year:</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/akismet-stats-1.png" rel="attachment wp-att-14743"><img loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/akismet-stats-1-1024x499.png" alt="akismet-stats" width="660" height="322" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-14743" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/akismet-stats-1-1024x499.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/12/akismet-stats-1-300x146.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/12/akismet-stats-1-768x374.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/12/akismet-stats-1-1200x585.png 1200w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/12/akismet-stats-1.png 1213w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px" /></a></p>
<p>That was an unexpected downward trend.</p>

<p>If I&#8217;ve never met you in any way shape or form, then I&#8217;m not going to accept a LinkedIn connection from you.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m pretty generous on the &#8220;met&#8221; part, for a few people this includes having only ever &#8220;met&#8221; online.  I should also note that in some cases even if I have met you, I won&#8217;t approve a LinkedIn connection.  That situation usually only comes up with recruiters.</p>
<p>In the last 6 months or so, I&#8217;ve noticed an increase in LinkedIn connect requests that appear to be run of the mill spam.  If we&#8217;ve never met and you want to get ahold of me, <a href="http://josephscott.org/contact/">try my contact form</a> instead.  Don&#8217;t send me a LinkedIn connection request, it will be ignored.</p>

<p>Now, if we could just get one of those fancy hologram based, interactive UIs for managing comments.  That part about having to carry transparent <strike>disks</strike> trays to move data is lame though.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you don&#8217;t count the mass amount of app &#8220;updates&#8221; in the news feed, Facebook has done an okay job on limiting spam (some apps on the other hand like to spam at will).  That seems to have changed about 10 days ago.  Someone has been generating large numbers of fake accounts that only have two pieces of data: a profile picture (usually an indecent picture of a woman) and a single wall entry about winning a free iPhone (with a link to the site).</p>
<p>Some how I&#8217;ve ended up on their list of people to abuse with friend requests.  Days with 20 or more friend requests from these fake iPhone give away accounts is not unusual.  That is no where near the number of spam emails and comments I get on an average day, but I&#8217;d rather see a trend towards less spam, not more.  That and Gmail does a reasonable job of filtering out email spam and Akismet takes care of the comment spam.</p>
<p>Facebook is a giant target for spammers, with so many people actively using the site it is a temptation they simply can&#8217;t pass up.  Finding ways to crack down on fake accounts is the major issue.  Once a fake account is in the system then it has the potential for relaying spam.  The ideal solution would be to identify these accounts as they are being created and prevent them from becoming active.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not a big user of Facebook, but I wish them the best of luck at solving this issue, because reducing the amount of spam on the Internet makes the world a better place.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[One of the neat things about Google Docs is the ability to share the document with others. You can do this with anyone just by knowing their email address. Google will then send an email out that looks something like: I&#8217;ve shared a document with you called &#8220;Spam sharing test&#8221;: http://docs.google.com/a/example.com/Doc?id=xxxxxxxxxxxxxx&#038;invite= It&#8217;s not an attachment [&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the neat things about <a href="http://documents.google.com/">Google Docs</a> is the ability to share the document with others.  You can do this with anyone just by knowing their email address.  Google will then send an email out that looks something like:</p>
<blockquote><p>
I&#8217;ve shared a document with you called &#8220;Spam sharing test&#8221;:<br />
http://docs.google.com/a/example.com/Doc?id=xxxxxxxxxxxxxx&#038;invite=</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not an attachment &#8212; it&#8217;s stored online at Google Docs. To open this document, just click the link above.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>Shared this doc with you.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Which is a really handy way to collaborate with others on a document.  And it seems the spammers have discovered this as well.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve recently started seeing emails for documents that I&#8217;ve been invited to, which turn out to be just a bunch of spam.  They&#8217;ve taken Google Docs and are using it in an attempt to mask their spam from email filters, by providing link to a service you might normally trust.  I suspect that Gmail is unlikely to mark any doc invites as spam.</p>
<p>Currently this seems to be pretty limited, the spammers have to paste in the email addresses into an invite box.  Google could do some basic things to prevent spammy looking invites from going out (do you really mean to invite 3.78 million people to share your document?).  I&#8217;m not aware of a Google Docs API that allows you to script doc invites, but if there is one (or if they come out with one later) then you can bet the spammers will make use of that as well.</p>
<p>This will turn into another wack-a-mole situation, where Google will (hopefully) revoke accounts and API keys for users who are sending out spam in this way.  Then the spammer will just start using another one of the 324,834 accounts that they&#8217;ve already created at Google until it gets blocked too.  Rinse, lather and repeat.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Like so many other folks I&#8217;ve been routing my email through <a>Gmail</a>.  For me this was mostly about dealing with spam.  On an average day I get 300+, so off to Gmail it goes.  It&#8217;s never been perfect, usually letting through less than 10 a day, but that was manageable.  Now I&#8217;ve got a whole new problem.</p>
<p>Sometime after the new year (as far as I can tell) Gmail started marking legit emails as spam.  After trolling through my spam folder I found several emails that weren&#8217;t spam, so they never made it to my inbox.  Hard to make out exactly what the trend is, so far it&#8217;s about 10 a week.</p>
<p>I would much rather have some spam hit my inbox than to have legit email get marked as spam.  I&#8217;m now left with the reality that I&#8217;ll have to dig through the spam folder at the end of every day to make sure I didn&#8217;t miss anything, not a pleasant thought.  My confidence and happiness with Gmail has gone done several notches because of this.</p>
<p>Just in case this is a system wide issue you may want to take a peek at your Gmail spam folder and see if you are having the same problem.</p>

<p>Has anyone done any formal studies, watching regular users, to find out which one people find easier to use?  Another factor to look for might be which one causes the most errors or failures to complete the process.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On January 5th, 2006 I <a href="http://joseph.randomnetworks.com/archives/2006/01/05/akismet/">turned on</a> the <a href="http://akismet.com/">Akismet</a> <a href="http://akismet.com/download/">WordPress plugin</a> for filtering comments and trackbacks.  It wasn&#8217;t perfect (<a href="http://joseph.randomnetworks.com/archives/2006/02/06/akismet-review/">one month review</a> showed ~ 0.1875% false positives) and <a href="http://joseph.randomnetworks.com/archives/2006/03/24/akismet-problems/">went down</a> a couple of times, but after one year I&#8217;d say it is good enough.  After a couple of months the volume of spam was so high that I stopped going through the spam queue, hoping that anyone with a comment that never showed up would <a href="http://joseph.randomnetworks.com/contact/">contact me</a> to tell me about it.</p>
<p>Any comments marked as spam by Akismet are deleted after 15 days.  That doesn&#8217;t seem like a very long time, but on this blog that queue is over 10,000 comments lately.  I can&#8217;t imagine having to review more than 20,000 comments every month.  Ug.</p>
<p>After one year my WordPress dashboard indicates that Akismet has blocked more than 112,000 comments and trackbacks as spam.</p>
<p><b>UPDATE Sat 6 Jan 2006 @ 7:30am :</b> Wouldn&#8217;t you know it, the next morning after writing this Akismet let some 50 or so obvious comment spam get through.  Looks like they were having problems around 3am, all of these comments came in at about that time.  So it isn&#8217;t perfect, but I wouldn&#8217;t even think of turning it off.</p>

<p><b>UPDATE Fri 24 Mar 2006 @ 4:30pm:</b> I suspect the problems I&#8217;ve been having are related to <a href="http://akismet.com/blog/2006/03/interruption/">Akismet database problem</a> that was just reported.  Interesting that the problem seems to involve taking too long to get a response back for free users.</p>

<p>The numbers involved don&#8217;t appear to be quite as bad as the WordPress incident either, with <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Traveling+to+a+Tech+Show%22+site:oreillynet.com&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;c2coff=1&amp;filter=0">Google finding less than 600 pages</a> with these ads for oreillynet.com.  If the other sites have a similar number of pages with ads then all told it would less than 5000 pages.  A lot of these ads point to freehotelsearch.com, which seems to offer a legitimate service (I only looked up reservations, I didn&#8217;t actually place one).</p>
<p>I think one could argue that these ads aren&#8217;t completely wrong.  The argument would come down to intent, are these links there in hopes that people will actually click on them, or are they more of an effort to trick search engines to increase their importance?  They are links, so it is possible that someone might click on them, but they aren&#8217;t nearly as prominent as the rest of their ads.  I&#8217;m leaning more towards the idea that these ads are there more to boost their search engine ranking than as traditional ads.  Tim is going to have a tough time making this look legit.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE 8:30am 24 Aug 2005:</strong> Tim O&#8217;Reilly has a posted an <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2005/08/search_engine_s_2.html">initial response</a> to the complaints about the ads.  The short version: while not completely wrong (and not nearly as bad as the WordPress spam) these types of ads aren&#8217;t good for the long term.</p>
