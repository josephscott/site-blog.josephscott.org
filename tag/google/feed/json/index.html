The Google status page confirmed my suspicions.\nThis got me thinking about how services convey failure messages.  In the broad sense there are at least two types of failure messages a service needs to provide.  The first is some sort of user error, which is the one Google provided me yesterday.  The second is a general &#8216;hey, we are down right now&#8217; message.\nMy initial confusion and concern during the Google Docs downtime came from Google mixing up these two types of messages.  The provided me with the first type ( user error ), when really it was the second type ( system is down ).",
