										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So I&#8217;ve got a Dell system coming to my house.  They called me this morning to let me know that it was ready and would probably be arriving in the next week or so and wanted to verify the shipping address.  Fair enough, but did they really need to do that at 6:30am?  Sarah was none too thrilled to be woken up by the phone at that hour, and was really not impressed that it was Dell.  A family emergency is one thing, but confirming a shipping address?  That can wait until later in the morning.</p>
