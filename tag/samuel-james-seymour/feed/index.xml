										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Seven or eight years ago Sarah and I were watching old episodes of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I've_Got_a_Secret">I&#8217;ve Got a Secret</a> from the 1950s.  One specific guest stood out and gave me the chills &#8211; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_J._Seymour">Samuel James Seymour</a>, he was in Ford&#8217;s Theater the night that Abraham Lincoln was shot:</p>

<p>The episode was from <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0609689/">9 Feb 1956</a>.  This is part of what was so amazing to me, my parents were children when this episode aired.  And here I was watching a video recording of a man who was there, in the theater, when the assassination happened on 14 April 1865.  He was 5 years old at the time.  Mr. Seymour passed away just two months after that episode.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve ever had that feeling of a connection with history you understand how I feel when I watch this.</p>
