										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Exactly one year ago today it was announced that part of the <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/6/6/3067523/linkedin-password-leak-online">LinkedIn password database had been shared online</a>.  <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/unt92/russian_hackers_claim_to_have_65m_linkedin/">There</a> <a href="http://blog.linkedin.com/2012/06/06/updating-your-password-on-linkedin-and-other-account-security-best-practices/">were</a> <a href="http://blog.linkedin.com/2012/06/06/linkedin-member-passwords-compromised/">many</a> <a href="http://blog.linkedin.com/2012/06/07/taking-steps-to-protect-our-members/">posts</a> <a href="http://blog.linkedin.com/2012/06/09/an-update-on-taking-steps-to-protect-our-members/">about</a> <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4073309">it</a>.</p>
<p>Having your password database compromised is bad.  But that turned out to not be the worst part of what happened.  Although I didn&#8217;t see it mentioned in any of the official LinkedIn posts, people quickly realized that the passwords were hashed using SHA-1.  No salts, no stretching, just a plain, single round, SHA-1.  That made finding the plain text version of the password for millions of LinkedIn accounts fairly simple.  </p>
<p>Using bcrypt with a decent random salt generator and good work factor would have been much better.</p>
<p>This made it very clear to me that if a site like LinkedIn can make the mistake of using a poor password storage method, anyone can.  I made a repeating calendar entry for 6 June of every year to be &#8220;Password Anniversary Day&#8221;.  On Password Anniversary Day ( 6/6 ) I pick a few sites that I have accounts on, more or less at random, and change my password.  Just in case.</p>
<p>My Tweet about this on 6 June 2012:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Welcome to the first annual &quot;change your <a href="http://t.co/utIhGP9J">http://t.co/utIhGP9J</a> password&quot; day <a href="http://t.co/DP88nDF1">http://t.co/DP88nDF1</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Joseph Scott (@josephscott) <a href="https://twitter.com/josephscott/status/210388473125945344?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 6, 2012</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Happy Password Anniversary Day everyone.</p>

<p>If I&#8217;ve never met you in any way shape or form, then I&#8217;m not going to accept a LinkedIn connection from you.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m pretty generous on the &#8220;met&#8221; part, for a few people this includes having only ever &#8220;met&#8221; online.  I should also note that in some cases even if I have met you, I won&#8217;t approve a LinkedIn connection.  That situation usually only comes up with recruiters.</p>
<p>In the last 6 months or so, I&#8217;ve noticed an increase in LinkedIn connect requests that appear to be run of the mill spam.  If we&#8217;ve never met and you want to get ahold of me, <a href="http://josephscott.org/contact/">try my contact form</a> instead.  Don&#8217;t send me a LinkedIn connection request, it will be ignored.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last week I linked to <a href="http://josephscott.org/archives/2013/05/avoid-speculation-questions/">Ted Dziuba&#8217;s post, The Speculation Trap</a>.  I noticed a LinkedIn profile link on <a href="http://teddziuba.com/">http://teddziuba.com/</a>, which I clicked on, curious to know a little bit more about Ted.  Off I go to http://www.linkedin.com/in/teddziuba and I get presented with this really annoying message:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://sharedat.net/f/kD/kDuY/linked-in-3rd-degree-profile.png" width="658" height="94" class="aligncenter" /></p>
<p>I&#8217;m already signed into LinkedIn, and apparently Ted is a 3rd degree connection for me.  This triggers a response on LinkedIn that hides all of the profile information unless I upgrade to a paid account.  I like LinkedIn, but don&#8217;t have an interest in paying $20 &#8211; $75 per month for it.</p>
<p>Turns out there is a very simple work around to the 3rd degree connection paywall.  Logout of LinkedIn, then view the profile page again.  You will be able to see the bulk of the profile information.  </p>
<p>In my case I use Chrome as my main browser, which means a Shift-Command-N ( on the Mac ) brings up an incognito window where I&#8217;m not signed into LinkedIn.  Toss in a copy-and-paste and you have a quick way around the LinkedIn 3rd degree connection paywall.</p>
<p>It feels wrong for a site to be more useful when I&#8217;m signed out than when I&#8217;m signed in.</p>
