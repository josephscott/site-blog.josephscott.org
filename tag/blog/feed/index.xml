<p>Several folks noticed a problem with the <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/">Official Google Blog</a> recently.  I ran into this via <a href="http://www.bloglines.com/">Bloglines</a> with the post <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2006/03/google-fix-your-blog-pleeasssee-3-p.html">Google, fix your blog pleeasssee! &lt;3 (P.S.

<p>Turns out that <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2006/03/and-were-back.html">Google had deleted their own blog</a>.</p>
<p>Cool, the folks at <a href="http://blog.searchenginewatch.com/blog/060328-011003">Search Engine Watch have a screen shot of the full post</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It has been about six weeks since I wrote my <a href="http://joseph.randomnetworks.com/archives/2006/02/06/akismet-review/">review of Akismet</a>.  Things had been going fine, but the last week or so has seen a large increase in the number of comment spam items that are not being caught, especially yesterday and today.  I&#8217;ve asked about this via their <a>contact form</a> to see if this is something unique to me or if there is something going on at <a href="http://akismet.com/">Akismet</a>.</p>
<p><b>UPDATE Fri 24 Mar 2006 @ 4:30pm:</b> I suspect the problems I&#8217;ve been having are related to <a href="http://akismet.com/blog/2006/03/interruption/">Akismet database problem</a> that was just reported.  Interesting that the problem seems to involve taking too long to get a response back for free users.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last week <a href="http://www.russellbeattie.com/notebook/">Russell</a> brought up the idea of an <a href="http://www.russellbeattie.com/notebook/1008477.html">RSS only blog</a>.  The general idea is to only provide content via a feed instead of the traditional web page method.  I think this quickly became an interesting question that wasn&#8217;t going to develop in to something particularly useful.  Producing something usable wasn&#8217;t as important the other ideas that this question spawned and the conversation surrounding it.</p>
<p>The next experiment with blogging and feeds that Russell is <a href="http://www.russellbeattie.com/notebook/1008482.html">trying out is forms in feeds</a>.  He took the first logical step, adding a comment form as part of a blog entry in his feed.  I tried it out in <a href="http://www.bloglines.com/">Bloglines</a> and it seemed to work correctly.  There are a few problems that I see with this though.</p>
<ol>
<li>Information (like your name, URL and email) can&#8217;t be remembered via this method.  I suppose there will be some who will see this as a good excuse to extend RSS or ATOM.  I don&#8217;t think it is worth it.</li>
<li>Potential for comment spam.  Russell moderates all of his comments so it isn&#8217;t a huge issue for him.  I&#8217;ve said it before, if you are going to try something new or develop a new technology, take some time to think about how it can be used for evil.  Yes comment spam is evil.</li>
<li>It may not work in all cases.  That might turn out to be a none issue, after all there is nothing stopping people from adding comments the old fashioned way.</li>
</ol>
<p>I think there is some potential here, although I think a variant of this idea will be more useful.  I&#8217;d like to see a link that pops up a little comment window.  It would work similar to the way the <a href="http://del.icio.us/doc/about">del.icio.us bookmarklet</a> does, it would be able to remember your info, ask some additional info to avoid comment spam and should work in most cases because it simply another link.  I should work up a WordPress plugin or something to try out this idea.  In the mean time try out Russell&#8217;s comment form in his feed and see what you think.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you&#8217;ve ever been here before you&#8217;ll probably quickly realize that I&#8217;ve redesigned the site.  I finally took some time over a few weeks to put together my own layout.  I borrowed the feel of the layout from <a href="http://www.russellbeattie.com/notebook/">Russell Beattie</a>.  I&#8217;m not done yet, but it seems to be functional, so I figured it was better to get it up an live than to wait for it be complete/perfect.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m making more use of <a href="http://www.wordpress.org/">WordPress</a>&#8216;s page feature and several plugins to get the features that I wanted.  Here&#8217;s a list of the plugins I&#8217;m using (so far):</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.meyerweb.com/eric/tools/wordpress/wp-gatekeeper.html">WP-GateKeeper</a> to prevent comment spam.  This is a plugin that I was already using, but it is worth another mention.</li>
<li><a href="http://vapourtrails.ca/wp-keywords">Jerome&#8217;s Keywords Plugin</a>: This plugin manages tags for WP posts.  This seems to be one of the best tag plugins for WP, it certainly has a lot of documention.</li>
<li><a href="http://priyadi.net/archives/2005/03/02/wordpress-php-exec-plugin/">WordPress PHP Exec Plugin</a>: The pages feature in WP is nice, but I needed to be able to run code from within a page, this plugin has worked well for that so far.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the short term I need to get some sort search functionality going again.  Perhaps I&#8217;ll just stick with using Google for that.  I&#8217;m hoping that tagging my posts will be more useful than using the categories support in WP.</p>
