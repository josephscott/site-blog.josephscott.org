I was trying to convince another team to take a different approach to a problem. I tried to make my arguments with code, prototyping alternatives to prove my point. My suggestions fell on deaf ears. But that&#8217;s because I was doing it wrong. I should have taken the time to build relationships with that team so we understood each other&#8217;s perspectives. Without that we were talking past each other. I remained unswayed by their arguments, they ignored mine.

<p>&#8211; Brett Slatkin, <a href="http://www.onebigfluke.com/2013/11/programming-is-a-social-endeavor.html">Programming is primarily a social endeavor</a></p>
<p>This is a good general rule, definitely not limited to just programming.  It reminds me of the saying &#8220;people don&#8217;t care how much you know, until they know how much you care&#8221;.</p>
<p>Just because programming is a strongly technology driven arena doesn&#8217;t prevent it from having the same human interaction issues that every other human endeavor has had.</p>
