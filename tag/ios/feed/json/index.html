I tried it out for a few minutes this morning.  The app itself is ok, though doesn&#8217;t really look like an iOS app.  I suspect it was built with one of the multiplatform SDKs out there.</p>\n<p>One of the features in the app was to report a problem.  I have a cross walk signal at a major intersection near my house that doesn&#8217;t work properly, so I used the app to report that.  The process wasn&#8217;t as smooth as it could have been, but was certainly usable.  The ultimate proof is if I hear anything back about it actually getting fixed though.</p>\n<p>There are several things that could be done to improve this app, but they aren&#8217;t big enough to ruin the overall usefulness of the app.  This is a good first version of the app and for something that came out of a city government I&#8217;d call it really good.</p>\n",
            "content_text": "The city of Sandy, Utah has a mobile app for iOS devices.  I tried it out for a few minutes this morning.  The app itself is ok, though doesn&#8217;t really look like an iOS app.  I suspect it was built with one of the multiplatform SDKs out there.\nOne of the features in the app was to report a problem.  I have a cross walk signal at a major intersection near my house that doesn&#8217;t work properly, so I used the app to report that.  The process wasn&#8217;t as smooth as it could have been, but was certainly usable.
