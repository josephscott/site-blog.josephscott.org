										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve been playing with some Python recently ( I will write more about that in a future post ) and there are two things that still trip me up on a regular basis.</p>
<p>The first issue I&#8217;ve run into is following Python style ( aka <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/">PEP 8</a> ).  Honestly, I&#8217;m just not excited about putting in the work to make sure I&#8217;m following all of the guidelines.  I&#8217;d rather let the computer deal with that busy work.  Enter: <a href="https://github.com/ambv/black">Black</a>.</p>
<p>Black is &#8220;the uncompromising Python code formatter&#8221;.  While it is still listed as beta, I&#8217;ve been very happy with it so far.  I let it take care of cleaning up the various style items that I&#8217;ve missed.</p>
<p>If getting Python style just right doesn&#8217;t excite you, I recommend trying out Black.</p>
<hr />
<p>The second issue is having spaces/indentation be significant.  I finally made a small change to my Python code to adjust my Vim setup.  I add this to the top of the file:</p>
<blockquote><p>
# vim: expandtab
</p></blockquote>
<p>That tells Vim to expand a tab into spaces.</p>
<p>I still don&#8217;t think having spacing be significant in source code is a good idea.  However, the above setting has made my &#8220;editing Python code with Vim&#8221; experience less frustrating.</p>

<blockquote><p>
pex is a library for generating .pex (Python EXecutable) files which are executable Python environments in the spirit of virtualenvs. pex is an expansion upon the ideas outlined in PEP 441 and makes the deployment of Python applications as simple as cp. pex files may even include multiple platform-specific Python distributions, meaning that a single pex file can be portable across Linux and OS X.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Brian Wickman covers the basics of how this works in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmpnGhRwsu0">17 minute video</a>.  The video is definitely worth watching if you are curious about this.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you are doing lots of work with dates and times in Python you may want to look at <a href='http://crsmithdev.com/arrow/'>Arrow</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Arrow is a Python library that offers a sensible, human-friendly approach to creating, manipulating, formatting and converting dates, times, and timestamps. It implements and updates the datetime type, plugging gaps in functionality, and provides an intelligent module API that supports many common creation scenarios. Simply put, it helps you work with dates and times with fewer imports and a lot less code.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Every language needs something like <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/function.strtotime.php">strtotime</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It has been <a href="https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.0/">more than 5 years</a> since Python 3.0 was released.  Last week I mentioned a <a href="https://josephscott.org/archives/2015/05/python-3-killing-python-medium/">Python 2 vs. 3 article</a> that pitched a reviving of Python 2.</p>
<p>With all that in mind, here is the <a href="http://astrofrog.github.io/blog/2015/05/09/2015-survey-results/">2015 Python scientists survey</a> from Thomas Robitaille.  The main results:</p>
<ul>
<li>83% reported using Python 2.x ( 2.6 &amp; 2.7 )</li>
<li>17% reported using Python 3.x ( 3.4 )</li>
</ul>
<p>This might not be as bad as it sounds.  He did a <a href="http://astrofrog.github.io/blog/2013/01/13/what-python-installations-are-scientists-using/">similar survey</a> in November 2012 ( nearly 3 years after Python 3.0 ) that reported Python 3.x usage in the 1% range.</p>
<p>That is an average increase of 8% across the roughly two years between the surveys.  If that remains constant it will be another 9 years before 2.x usage drops below 10%.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Major upgrades to programming languages often run into difficult uphill battles.  From <a href="http://blog.thezerobit.com/2014/05/25/python-3-is-killing-python.html">Python 3 is killing Python</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
People either continue to write software in Python 2 or they pick another language that did not shoot itself in the face.</p>
<p>I have been building applications and services in Python 3. I’m not blown away by it. It is very similar to writing software in Python 2, except that there is a much smaller pool of 3rd party libraries available.</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p>There are other solutions, but reviving Python 2 is so obviously the correct thing to do, that other solutions are not worth mentioning.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Clearly not everyone agrees that re-focusing on Python 2 is a good idea.</p>
<p>See also PHP 6 and Perl 6.</p>
