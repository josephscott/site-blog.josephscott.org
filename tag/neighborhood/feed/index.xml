										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the last year I&#8217;ve talked with several people about the type ofÂ neighborhoodÂ I want to live in. Â I like the idea of living in a place where when new neighbors move in people go over to introduce themselves and bring them dinner. Â I like the idea of having neighborhood BBQs when the weather is nice.</p>
<p>So my wife and I have made it a point to do those things. Â We bring dinner over when we see a new neighbor move in, have BBQ in the circle during the summer, and invite neighbors over for dinner at our house from time to time. Â At a high level we make an effort to shape the type of neighborhood we live in. Â It isn&#8217;t always easy (and sometimes takes a fair bit of work), but it has always been worth it. Â In the coming year we are going to try and do more along the same lines, which seems to mostly involve sharing food with people who live around us. Â What can I say, I like to eat <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="ðŸ™‚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>As we start this new year of 2013 the idea I want to put out there is to shape the neighborhood you live in. Â Think about two or three specific things you wished your neighborhood did. Â Then make plans to take the lead and do them this year. Â Here are a few examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Invite a neighbor over to eat dinner every three or four months</li>
<li>Plan a neighborhood 4th of July party</li>
<li>Shovel the snow off a neighbor&#8217;s drive way</li>
<li>Make a Christmas cookie sample platter of home made treats and take them around to your neighbors during the holidays</li>
</ul>
<p>Or make up one of your own. Â Make 2013 the year that you and your family put in an extra effort to positively shape the neighborhood you live in. Â We may not be able to solve all of the woes in the world in one year, but each of us can make our individual neighborhoods a bit friendlier, and that counts for something.</p>
