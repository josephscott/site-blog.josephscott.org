First, reading the account of someone who was hit with a SIM card swap attack &#8211; where someone else calls up your mobile carrier claiming to be you and has your phone number moved to a new SIM card.

The default method was a code sent via SMS, and given the power of defaults I expect most people will pick that one.  Fortunately they do offer a way to use <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-based_One-time_Password_algorithm\">TOTP ( Time base One Time Password )</a> codes, so the situation wasn&#8217;t as bad as it could have been.</p>\n<p>At best I&#8217;d call that 1.5FA instead of 2FA.</p>\n<p>However, I&#8217;ve reached a point where any mention of SMS as a 2FA ( Two Factor Authentication ) option should come with a large warning in red blinking text about how this really isn&#8217;t what you want to do.</p>\n<h3>What To Use Instead</h3>\n<p>I strongly prefer the TOTP option instead, with a mobile app like <a href=\"https://authy.com/\">Authy</a>, <a href=\"https://duo.com/\">Duo</a>, <a href=\"https://freeotp.github.io/\">FreeOTP</a>, or <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/google-authenticator/id388497605\">Google Authenticator</a>.</p>\n<p>Standard disclaimer applies here, nothing is perfect.
