										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Just so that I&#8217;m clear, here is the message:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Sending a code via SMS to a mobile phone does not count as Two Factor Authentication ( 2FA ).
</p></blockquote>
<p>I saw two things recently that brought up this issue again.  First, reading the account of someone who was hit with a SIM card swap attack &#8211; where someone else calls up your mobile carrier claiming to be you and has your phone number moved to a new SIM card.  That led to all sorts of pain from accounts that considered his phone number to be a trusted source of authentication.</p>
<p>The second trigger in all of this was seeing a notification from a financial institution that was going to start enabling &#8220;Two Factor Authentication&#8221; on accounts.  The default method was a code sent via SMS, and given the power of defaults I expect most people will pick that one.  Fortunately they do offer a way to use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-based_One-time_Password_algorithm">TOTP ( Time base One Time Password )</a> codes, so the situation wasn&#8217;t as bad as it could have been.</p>
<p>At best I&#8217;d call that 1.5FA instead of 2FA.</p>
<p>However, I&#8217;ve reached a point where any mention of SMS as a 2FA ( Two Factor Authentication ) option should come with a large warning in red blinking text about how this really isn&#8217;t what you want to do.</p>
<h3>What To Use Instead</h3>
<p>I strongly prefer the TOTP option instead, with a mobile app like <a href="https://authy.com/">Authy</a>, <a href="https://duo.com/">Duo</a>, <a href="https://freeotp.github.io/">FreeOTP</a>, or <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/google-authenticator/id388497605">Google Authenticator</a>.</p>
<p>Standard disclaimer applies here, nothing is perfect.  Using a TOTP app won&#8217;t give you perfect security ( I&#8217;d argue that doesn&#8217;t exist ), but it is miles better than no 2FA and significantly better than SMS tokens.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/https-all-the-things-1.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/https-all-the-things-1.jpg" alt="https-all-the-things" width="400" height="300" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10791" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/https-all-the-things-1.jpg 400w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/08/https-all-the-things-1-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></a></p>
<p>Maybe not everything, but certainly more than we are doing now.</p>
<p>So how do you encourage more sites to use HTTPS?  Well, if you are Google, you tweak the SEO black box:</p>
<blockquote><p>
we&#8217;re starting to use HTTPS as a ranking signal. For now it&#8217;s only a very lightweight signal — affecting fewer than 1% of global queries, and carrying less weight than other signals such as high-quality content — while we give webmasters time to switch to HTTPS. But over time, we may decide to strengthen it, because we’d like to encourage all website owners to switch from HTTP to HTTPS to keep everyone safe on the web.
</p></blockquote>
<p>From <a href="http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.com/2014/08/https-as-ranking-signal.html">HTTPS as a ranking signal</a> on the Google Webmaster Central Blog.</p>
<p>The call to have more sites use HTTPS has been out for some time.  It is hard to be motivated enough to over come the technical and financial hurdles to make the move ( and for some sites those hurdles are non-trivial ).  The SEO approach that Google is taking is the equivalent of hitting sites in the wallet ( in some cases that might be the literal result ).  When the possibility of loosing money is involved then it is easier to get people&#8217;s attention.</p>
<p>This might be the single best use of the crazy Google SEO situation I&#8217;ve ever seen.</p>
<p>Earlier this summer Automattic talked about working towards <a href="http://en.blog.wordpress.com/2014/06/05/reset-the-net/">providing all *.wordpress.com sites with HTTPS by the end of 2014</a>.  This is something that I&#8217;m really excited to see happen.</p>
<p>If you still aren&#8217;t supporting HTTPS for your site, I&#8217;d encourage you to map out a plan to get there.  Tim Bray posted a simple <a href="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2012/12/02/HTTPS">outline of the why and how of switching to HTTPS</a>.  If you are looking for a more technical view of how HTTPS works check out <a href="http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1230000000545/ch04.html">the TLS chapter of &#8220;High Performance Browser Networking&#8221;</a>, which is free to read online.</p>
