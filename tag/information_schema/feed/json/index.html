            "content_html": "<p>This morning I went on a hunt to find out where SQL Server 2000 keeps the view definitions for a database.  I quickly came across information_schema feature (seems that having information_schema is part of the <a href=\"http://www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/~shadow/sql/sql1992.txt\">SQL92</a> standard) which exposes view details via <a href=\"http://www.transactsql.com/html/infoschemaviews.html\">information_schema.views</a>.  I was hoping that would be the end of my journey, but then I ran into a problem.</p>\n<p>Go back and look at the details for the <a href=\"http://www.transactsql.com/html/infoschemaviews.html\">Information_Schema.Views</a>, pay close attention to the VIEW_DEFINITION column.  It turns out that if the view definition is more than 4000 characters then it returns NULL.  Why they didn&#8217;t just make it a TEXT field I do not know.  Of course one of the two view definitions that I was looking for was returning NULL.  At least I had figured out why, now I needed to know how to get around it.</p>\n<p>I knew I could not have been the only one to run into this, so it was back to searching for a solution.  I eventually came across a <a href=\"http://www.experts-exchange.com/Databases/Microsoft_SQL_Server/Q_20634183.html\">post about sp_helptext</a> that gets around the 4000 character limit.  It turns out that <a href=\"http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms176112.aspx\">sp_helptext</a> will not only give you a view definition, but also triggers, functions, check constraints and stored procedures.  Quite handy to have around.  So I was able to get the view definition I was looking for (broken up across multiple rows) with:</p>\n<p><code><br />\nEXEC sp_helptext 'my_view_name'<br />\n</code></p>\n<p>You&#8217;ll still have to put all the rows back together to get the complete view definition, but that it much better than just getting NULL.  Of course if I could figure out what the Information_Schema.Views or sp_helptext is looking at to get the actual view definition I could do it myself.  So far I haven&#8217;t been able to find that information, and I&#8217;m not sure that I&#8217;m going to spend much time looking since I have a workable solution at this point.</p>\n<p>As an added bonus, go back to the <a href=\"http://www.transactsql.com/html/infoschemaviews.html\">Information_Schema.Views</a> page again and take a look at the IS_UPDATABLE column notes.  Turns out that it always returns NO.</p>\n<p>While it was nice of Microsoft to include the Information_Schema.Views as part of SQL Server 2000, don&#8217;t depend on the data they provide, in some cases it will be wrong.  I haven&#8217;t looked to see if this is something that has been fixed in SQL Server 2005.</p>\n<p><b>UPDATE Tue 21 Mar 2006 @ 4:00pm:</b> Turns out that getting the definitions of the Information_Schema.Views and sp_helptext is fairly simple.  They are kept in the master database in SQL Server 2000.  Connect to the master database and take a look at the views, you&#8217;ll see several that are owned by INFORMATION_SCHEMA.  Then take a look at the listing for Stored Procedures.  There are tons of sp_* procedures, one of which is sp_helptext.  This lead me to running <code>exec sp_helptext 'sp_helptext'</code> to get the definition of sp_helptext.  You can also look at it by looking at the properties of sp_helptext, but you&#8217;ll be doing a lot scrolling in a little tiny window.
