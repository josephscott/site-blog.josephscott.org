To open this document, just click the link above.<br />\n&#8212;</p>\n<p>Shared this doc with you.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Which is a really handy way to collaborate with others on a document.  And it seems the spammers have discovered this as well.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve recently started seeing emails for documents that I&#8217;ve been invited to, which turn out to be just a bunch of spam.

Google could do some basic things to prevent spammy looking invites from going out (do you really mean to invite 3.78 million people to share your document?).  I&#8217;m not aware of a Google Docs API that allows you to script doc invites, but if there is one (or if they come out with one later) then you can bet the spammers will make use of that as well.</p>\n<p>This will turn into another wack-a-mole situation, where Google will (hopefully) revoke accounts and API keys for users who are sending out spam in this way.
