										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The idea of paving roads with solar panels has started entering real world trials.  <a href="http://www.globalconstructionreview.com/trends/france-pa7ve-1000km-ro7ad-so7lar-panel7s/">France plans to do 1,000km of road</a>, the <a href="http://www.sciencealert.com/solar-roads-in-the-netherlands-are-working-even-better-than-expected">Netherlands did a 70m solar road</a>, and <a href="http://solarroadways.com/">Solar Roadways</a> wants to do the same thing in the US.</p>
<p>I really like the theory, we&#8217;ve got large areas that are getting paved anyway, why not have them generate power at the same time.  But it isn&#8217;t until you deploy it in the real world, for long periods of time, that you discover all of the various issues that can come up.  Maintenance work is a big deal, think of how often roads are re-paved.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m excited to see these test systems go live.  That is how we&#8217;ll learn about their weaknesses ( and how to fix them ) and their strengths.</p>
<p>You could say this is where the rubber meets the ( solar ) road.</p>

<p>This feels like a potential market waiting to be explored.  I suspect there is a mountain of legal and regulatory paperwork that would need to be ascended before it could be done on a large scale ( the entire United States for instance ).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There is an excellent post about <a href="http://perspectives.mvdirona.com/2012/03/17/ILoveSolarPowerBut.aspx">the viability of solar power at data centers</a> by James Hamilton.</p>
<p>The follow up discussion in the comments are great, definitely worth reading.  Power density at a data center versus other spaces (homes, offices, retail, etc.) is what really seems to make the math so bad.  I am curious to see if there is anything significant to the idea of solar panels on the roof also helping reduce peak heat exposure.</p>
<p>I love seeing attempts at figuring out the math behind what would be most efficient instead of the most placating. </p>
