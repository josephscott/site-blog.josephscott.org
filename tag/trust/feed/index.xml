										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last week Fred Wilson suggested that he would <a href="http://avc.com/2014/06/feature-friday-trust/">add trust to his &#8220;Top 10 Golden Rules For Successful Web Apps&#8221;</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
&#8230; privacy is part of the brand promise &#8230;
</p></blockquote>
<p>That includes the lack of privacy.</p>
<blockquote><p>
Going back to why in early 2010 I didn’t put Trust in my top ten – it may be that Facebook’s assault on our privacy and the loss of trust that ensued was just developing in our collective consciousness at that time. And now we live in a more paranoid state about this stuff.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Customer trust is no longer just a company cultural target, trust is a feature.  Being a feature means it requires specific decisions to be made about it, decisions that should not be changed lightly.</p>
