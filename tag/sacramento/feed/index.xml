<p>As I&#8217;ve already mentioned, we <a href="http://joseph.randomnetworks.com/archives/2007/07/10/living-in-utah/">moved to Utah</a> this summer.  So our house in Sacramento that we lived in for 8 years is up <a href="http://template.metrolistmls.com/sacramentobee/cgi-bin/GetOne.cfm?MLSNum=70079830&amp;">for sale</a>.  If you are looking for a house in the Sacramento area here are the details.</p>
<ul>
<li>In the <a href="http://www.rosemontca.org/">Rosemont</a> area of Sacramento, just south of Watt &amp; 50, not far from the Watt/Manlove bus and light rail stop for <a href="http://www.sacrt.com/">Sacramento Regional Transit</a></li>
<li>Built in 1977</li>
<li>3 bedrooms, 2 baths, 1405 square feet</li>
<li>New HVAC</li>
<li>New water heater</li>
<li>New roof</li>
<li>New garage door</li>
<li>New dual pane windows</li>
<li>New paint, inside and out.  I rather like that blue trim.</li>
<li>New laminate flooring</li>
<li>New stove (and hood), dish washer, kitchen sink and faucet</li>
<li>New landscaping (lawn, automatic sprinkler system, fencing)</li>
<li>Remodeled master bath, updated front bath</li>
</ul>
<p>We replaced pretty much everything over the 8 years that we lived there.</p>
<p>The house is in the middle of a loop so there isn&#8217;t much car traffic.  The rooms are pretty big, my Cal King bed was no problem in the master bedroom.  The kitchen is large, with lots of cabinets.</p>
<p>If you are interested go check out the <a href="http://template.metrolistmls.com/sacramentobee/cgi-bin/GetOne.cfm?MLSNum=80010965&amp;">MLS listing for the house</a>.  Tell you what, if you buy my house because of this blog entry, I&#8217;ll do a follow up post linking to your blog/site as an added bonus <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At the beginning of January <a href="http://kalsey.com/blog/">Adam Kalsey</a> launched <a href="http://sacstarts.com/">SacStarts.com</a>.  The site grew out of Adam and <a href="http://www.tubesmusic.com/blog/">Scott Hildebrand</a> looking for tech get togethers in the Sacramento/Davis area.</p>
<p>Now there are informal monthly dinners for tech heads and entrepreneurs to get together and chat.  The <a href="http://sacstarts.com/events/2007/02/22/february-dinner">February dinner</a> in on the 22nd, 7pm at Hoppy Brewing Company on Folsom Blvd.  If you are in the area <a href="http://sacstarts.com/events/2007/02/22/february-dinner">signup</a>, the only cost is for your own dinner.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been to many of the dinners they&#8217;ve had so far and the conversation has always been interesting and informative.</p>
<p>In June there are plans for a <a href="http://sacstarts.com/events/2007/06/02/barcamp-sacramento">BarCamp Sacramento</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This morning there was a strong, unpleasant smell in the office and around the building.  A few people were felling ill and this lead to an evacuation of <a href="http://www.fm.csus.edu/Construction_Projects_Modoc_Hall.htm">Modoc Hall</a> at <a href="http://www.csus.edu/">CSU Sacramento</a> this morning.  My cube is on the first floor, although reports of the smell came from all over the building.</p>
<p>Everyone from our building was <a href="http://www.csus.edu/news/101906NapaModoc.stm">evacuated</a> out to the parking lot.  So most of my morning was spent standing around outside watching fireman, police, <a href="http://news10.net/storyfull2.aspx?storyid=20803">news</a> <a href="http://www.kcra.com/news/10114165/detail.html">crews</a> and a HazMat team check out Modoc Hall.  After lunch we were allowed back in, but no information was provided on what the odor was or where it came from.</p>
<p>Not exactly how I expected today to go <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f641.png" alt="🙁" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The exciting news yesterday was that the date for the <a href="http://www.ldschurchtemples.com/cgi-bin/pages.cgi?sacramento&amp;announced">Sacramento California Temple</a> has been announced: Sunday 3 September 2006.  There will be an open house for the public starting 29 July through 26 August 2006.  So if you aren&#8217;t LDS and have an interest in see the temple contact one of your LDS friends and let them know.  It isn&#8217;t clear yet if you&#8217;ll need tickets or just show up for the open house.  Now that the date has been announced I expect the next few months will provide for greater details.</p>
<p>If you are curious how the construction is going they still have the <a href="http://www.sacramentotemple.net/templecam/">Sacramento Temple webcam</a> up.  I hope to swing by there sometime this week to take a few more pictures.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The June 2005 stake conference for the Sacramento Cordova California Stake (of <a href="http://www.lds.org/">The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints</a>) was last weekend (18-19 June 2005).  We were privileged to have Elder Richard G. Scott (of the Quorum of Twelve Apostles ) and Elder Won Yong Ko (a new Area Authority Seventy), who were there to call a new Stake President.  Donald G. Pebbles was released as Stake President, having served in that position for nine years.  Alan Fisher (previously the 1st Counselor in the Stake Presidency) was called as the new Stake President.  His counselors are Roy Bair and Craig Norman, both of whom were previously serving on the Stake High Council.</p>
<p>This was terrific conference.  Seeing Elder Scott use <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop/main.html">Adobe Photoshop</a> during some of his talks was a bit of a surprise.  For some reason this just struck me as neat.</p>
