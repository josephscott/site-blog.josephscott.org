										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I like watching DVDs with the commentary track turned on after I&#8217;ve seen them.  Some times you get interesting little bits of information that either weren&#8217;t in or weren&#8217;t obvious in the move itself.  This time I found out that <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0105435/fullcredits#writers">Sneakers</a> (1992) and <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0086567/fullcredits#writers">WarGames</a> (1983) were written by the same two people: <a href="http://imdb.com/name/nm0489623/">Lawrence Lasker</a> and <a href="http://imdb.com/name/nm0662748/">Walter F. Parkes</a>.  They mention that the idea for the movie Sneakers came about while doing research for WarGames.</p>
<p>Both of these movies are great, I highly recommend both of them.  And if you know what an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acoustic_coupler">acoustic coupler</a> is and you&#8217;ve never seen WarGames then you are missing out.</p>
