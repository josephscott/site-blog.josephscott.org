Unfortunately there was no link to reference where that number came from, so I went looking for supporting data.  I found it on the <a href=\"http://www.usmint.gov/about_the_mint/?action=annual_report\">United States Mint Annual Report</a> page.  Specifically the <a href=\"http://www.usmint.gov/downloads/about/annual_report/2011AnnualReport.pdf\">2011 Annual Report</a> (PDF), page 11.

Not hard to see how the math works against us there.
