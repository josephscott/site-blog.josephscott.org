										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A few facts about Earthquakes to start off your week.</p>
<ul>
<li>The largest recorded earthquake in the United States was a magnitude 9.2 that struck Prince William Sound, Alaska on Good Friday, March 28, 1964 UTC.</li>
<li>The largest recorded earthquake in the world was a magnitude 9.5 (Mw) in Chile on May 22, 1960.</li>
<li>The Wasatch Range, with its outstanding ski areas, runs North-South through Utah, and like all mountain ranges it was produced by a series of earthquakes. The 386 km (240-mile)-long Wasatch Fault is made up of several segments, each capable of producing up to a M7.5 earthquake. During the past 6000 years, there has been a M6.5+ about once every 350 years, and it has been 150 years since the last powerful earthquake.</li>
<li>From 1975-1995 there were only four states that did not have any earthquakes. They were: Florida, Iowa, North Dakota, and Wisconsin.</li>
<li>Florida and North Dakota have the smallest number of earthquakes in the United States.</li>
<li>Alaska is the most earthquake-prone state and one of the most seismically active regions in the world. Alaska experiences a magnitude 7 earthquake almost every year, and a magnitude 8 or greater earthquake on average every 14 years.</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At 11:45am (California time, PDT) there was an <a href="http://quake.wr.usgs.gov/recenteqs/Quakes/nc51161673.html">earthquake 8 miles east of Truckee, CA</a>, with a magnitude of 4.8.  I was sitting at a desk when it happened and I definitely felt it here in Sacramento, 92 miles away.  According to the <a href="http://pasadena.wr.usgs.gov/shake/STORE/X51161673/ciim_display.html">did you feel it map</a> for the quake, what I felt was at an intensity level of 2 (weak shaking and no damage).  I was at church so there were plenty of other people around to feel it, but no one that I asked (maybe 20 people) indicated that they had felt anything.</p>
<p>It has been a few years since I&#8217;ve felt an earthquake like this, if things like this didn&#8217;t have so much potential to cause harm it would be a fun ride <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="ðŸ™‚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
