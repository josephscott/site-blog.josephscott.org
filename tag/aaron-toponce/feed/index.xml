										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With some rough math Aaron Toponce comes up with an estimate for <a href="https://pthree.org/2016/01/30/bitcoin-mining-rate-and-waste/">Bitcoin Mining Rate and Waste</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
At $0.15 USD per kWh, that&#8217;s $609 spent on electricity per Bitcoin mined. Bitcoin is currently trading at $376/BTC.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Using the ~$600 cost in electricity for current mining rates, Bitcoin would need to go back to the highs of <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/charts">2013 and 2014</a> to have a net positive value.</p>
<p>Aaron is very direct in his conclusion:</p>
<blockquote><p>
I would argue that Bitcoin is the worst idea to come out of Computer Science in the history of mankind.
</p></blockquote>
<p>If this depends on the price per Bitcoin, then this conclusion needs to have more flexibility.  It may be that we are too early in the history of Bitcoin to write a conclusion.</p>
<p>In terms of overall issues with Bitcoin, I don&#8217;t think this one is big enough by itself to kill Bitcoin.  Combined with other issues though, it may prove unsustainable over all.</p>
