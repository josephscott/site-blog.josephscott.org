<p>I finished reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Innovators-Dilemma-Revolutionary-Business-Essentials/dp/0060521996">The Innovator&#8217;s Dilemma</a> by <a href="http://www.claytonchristensen.com/">Clayton M. Christensen</a> this week.  My thoughts in a nutshell: I really enjoyed reading this book.</p>
<p>A good portion of the book looks at the history of the disk drive industry, to compare sustaining versus disruptive developments.  No doubt this is one of the reasons I enjoyed reading this book so much.  Reading these sections was a trip down memory lane.  Other industries were also looked at, but not with as much detail.</p>
<p>Another reason I enjoyed this book is that Christensen clearly took the time and effort to define the issues at hand in simple terms, which goes a long way towards clarifying the issues.  Too many times I&#8217;ve heard people claim something to be disruptive to an industry, without any real thought as to what qualifies something to be disruptive.  And if it isn&#8217;t disruptive, what category is it in?  That&#8217;s where the comparison between sustaining and disruptive come in, and which types of companies are best at leveraging each.</p>
<p>One point that was brought up in a few different places was that of defining what a company can&#8217;t do.  This is usually in comparison to what a company can do.  Paying attention to what you aren&#8217;t good at is a hard mind set to develop.</p>
<p>Several times while reading this book I thought about the influence of open source products on the technology landscape.  In many cases they are spot on with Christensen&#8217;s definition of disruptive.  Generally less expensive than existing products.  Generally start out with a much smaller set of features.  They start off targeting a different group of customers and gradually work their way up the market.</p>
<p>So who would I recommend this book to?  Pretty much anyone in business, and those that enjoy business related topics.</p>
