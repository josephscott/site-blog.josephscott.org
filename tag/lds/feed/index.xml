										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This weekend is the <a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/?lang=eng">General Conference of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints</a>, a time where leaders of the church speak to the church as a whole.  As I listen to the speakers it is a time for me to reflect on how I can improve myself.</p>
<p>What has come to my mind is the story of Jesus and a lawyer discussing &#8220;who is my neighbour?&#8221; in <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/luke/10.25-37?lang=eng#25">Luke 10:25-37</a>.  Jesus described an injured man left &#8220;half dead&#8221; and three people who came across him.  Only the third stopped to help, making the point that the neighbor of the injured man was &#8220;He that shewed mercy on him&#8221;.  This is commonly referred to as the <a href="https://www.lds.org/bible-videos/videos/parable-of-the-good-samaritan?lang=eng">Parable of the Good Samaritan</a>.</p>
<p>Beyond traditional neighbors, re-reading this well known New Testament story reminds me that I also have neighbors of opportunity.  I feel like I need find more ways to show mercy to my neighbors of opportunity.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last Christmas I was given the book <a href="http://deseretbook.com/Rescue-Biography-Thomas-S-Monson-Heidi-Swinton/i/5051210">To the Rescue: The Biography of Thomas S. Monson</a>, and I finished reading it earlier this week.  <a href="http://www.thomassmonson.org/">Thomas Monson</a> is the President of <a href="http://lds.org/?lang=eng">The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints</a>.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve listened to many talks by President Monson over the years, mostly from <a href="http://lds.org/general-conference/conferences?lang=eng">General Conference</a>, so some of the stories from his biography I was familiar with.  The book fills in many more details and events that I wasn&#8217;t aware of though. </p>
<p>This book was really enjoyable to read.  In many cases the historical context of the events played a major role, the trips to East Germany for instance.  I remember when the Berlin wall fell while I was in high school, but I&#8217;d forgotten that the <a href="http://lds.org/church/temples/freiberg-germany?lang=eng">Freiberg, Germany temple</a> was actually built prior to that.  And I didn&#8217;t know that they&#8217;d gotten permission to send missionaries to and from Easy Germany before the fall of the wall.</p>
<p>It has always been amazing to me that he has served in full time leadership of the church for so many years.  I can&#8217;t imagine how much of a sacrifice this must have been for his wife Frances.  I don&#8217;t see how either of their lives could ever be described as easy.</p>
<p>Ultimately I give this book my highest praise: reading this book made me want to be a better person.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<figure style="width: 250px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://www.webpagetest.org/result/101201_17GA/"><img loading="lazy" alt="lds.org waterfall chart" src="http://cdn.webpagetest.org/result/101201_17GA/1_waterfall_thumb.png" title="lds.org waterfall chart" width="250" height="329" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">lds.org watefall chart</figcaption></figure>
<p>Development of a new version of <a href="http://lds.org/">lds.org</a> has been available on new.lds.org for some time.  As of 30 November 2010 that <a href="http://lds.org/church/news/new-lds.org-launched?lang=eng">new version is now live on lds.org</a>.  I&#8217;d taken a few quick looks at the performance of the new version previously, but with it now live this seemed like a good time to take a closer look.</p>
<p>First up, the <a href="http://www.webpagetest.org/result/101201_17GA/">webpagetest.org results for lds.org</a>.  Some numbers for reference:</p>
<ul>
<li>Data transfered: 1,287 KB</li>
<li>Number of HTTP requests: 66</li>
<li>Fully loaded time: 2.3 seconds (taken with a grain of salt, this is just a single test)</li>
</ul>
<p>The score for HTTP compression is an F, but that doesn&#8217;t really tell the whole story.  Most of the resources on the page are loaded from lds.org and cdn.lds.org.  Only cdn.lds.org (Apache web server) is responding with compressed results, lds.org (MarkLogic web server) never provides a compressed response.  This results in an <a href="http://www.webpagetest.org/result/101201_17GA/1/performance_optimization/#compress_text">extra 118 KB</a> sent over the wire.  Given the initial large size of the data transfer for the site this is not a huge dent, but still big enough to make a difference.  With HTTP compression enabled the total data count drops to 1,169 KB.</p>
<p>Something that would make a bigger dent is image optimization.  The <a href="http://www.webpagetest.org/result/101201_17GA/1/performance_optimization/#compress_images">image compression analysis</a> indicates another 478 KB in data savings that could be achieved.  Combined with HTTP compression support this brings the page down to 691 KB.  Addressing these two issues brings us down to 54% of the original page weight.  No doubt this would reduce the time it takes to fully load the page.  (Exactly how much you can reasonably compress a JPEG may vary, so take these numbers as a ball part estimate)</p>
<p>There are three external CSS files, <a href="http://www.webpagetest.org/result/101201_17GA/1/pagespeed/">minifying those would save another 17 KB</a>, bringing our running total down to 674 KB.  If you were to combine them as well you could cut out 2 HTTP requests entirely, which would help reduce the page load time.</p>
<p>Minifying the HTML output would cut out another 7 KB.  This gets us down to 667 KB.</p>
<p>I thought this was going to be it for data reduction, but then I took a closer look at the Javascript files, some of them could still be reduced (which I tested with <a href="http://closure-compiler.appspot.com/home">http://closure-compiler.appspot.com/home</a>):</p>
<ul>
<li>https://cdn.lds.org/ml/platform/scripts/platform-utilities.js &#8211; original 8 KB, compiled 6 KB</li>
<li>https://lds.org/resources/script/common/s_code_ldsall.js &#8211; original 12 KB, compiled 11 KB</li>
<li>https://lds.org/resources/script/common/content.js &#8211; original 1.6 KB, compiled 1.2 KB</li>
<li>https://lds.org/resources/script/pages/home.js &#8211; original 502 bytes, compiled 367 bytes</li>
</ul>
<p>All of those numbers are the compressed versions of the files.  They add up to an additional 3.5 KB of savings, which makes our new total 663.5 (664) KB.</p>
<p>All of those items together brings down the data transfer by nearly 50%.  There are other things besides reducing the total data numbers that we can do to improve the performance of the site.  </p>
<p>There are 46 parallelizable (is that a word?) requests to lds.org.   Browsers have been increasing the number of concurrent connections they&#8217;ll support for a single host, but 46 seems well beyond that.  Splitting that up across two or three host names would allow browsers to download more of the resources in parallel.  Same is true for cdn.lds.org, but on a smaller scale for this particular page, which loads 12 items from there.  Breaking that up across two or three host names would help.</p>
<p>I found the use of cdn.lds.org interesting.  This is a good first step, common files used across various church sites can load resources from there and hopefully see increased cache hits.  The &#8216;Expires&#8217; header puts some of the resources out as far as 20 years.  Others are as small as 4 hours, which should be increased.  Another common reason for using a CDN is the lack of cookies needed for the request.  Unfortunately using the same domain (lds.org and cdn.lds.org) means that requests to cdn.lds.org include the lds.org cookie.  </p>
<p>I looked at this in more detail after I logged into the site, the cookie data added an extra 421 bytes to each request sent to cdn.lds.org, that goes completely unused.  That comes out to some where around 5 KB of data sent to cdn.lds.org servers that is completely useless.  To add insult to injury, the cookie data is also sent when the browser checks to see if the file has been updated ( If-Modified-Since and If-None-Match ).  The solution would be to move the CDN to a separate domain name that is only used by the CDN and nothing else.  You still get the distributed site caching and additional parallel download benefits and the browser will never have additional (useless) cookie data to send for each request.</p>
<p>While on the topic of caching, many of the resources loaded from lds.org have a very short Expires setting, just one hour.  These could be cached for much longer, saving on bandwidth for subsequent page requests.</p>
<p>I already mentioned combining CSS files, the same could be done for some of the Javascript files as well.  Reducing the total number of HTTP requests cuts out the over head involved with each request.  Another option for reducing the number of requests is to combine some of the images into CSS sprites.</p>
<p>There are other things the site could do to improver performance (like moving more of the Javascript to the bottom of the page), but this list is a good start, with several options on how to improve the performance of the new <a href="http://lds.org/">lds.org</a> site.  Some are more involved than others, but in the end substantial reductions can be had in the amount of data transfered, the total number of resource requests on the page and the fully loaded time.</p>

A quick glance at the category scores (top right) shows that there is likely plenty of room for performance improvements.</p>
<h3>Compression</h3>
<p>The first thing that stood out was the lack of compression for resources.  Starting with the very first request, the HTML for http://beta-newsroom.lds.org/ there is no compressed version made available.  A simple way to confirm this is with curl:</p>
<p><code>curl -v &#8211; compressed http://beta-newsroom.lds.org/ > /dev/null</code></p>
<p>Which makes an HTTP request that looks like:</p>
<p><code><br />
> GET / HTTP/1.1<br />
> User-Agent: curl/7.19.7 (universal-apple-darwin10.0) libcurl/7.19.7 OpenSSL/0.9.8l zlib/1.2.3<br />
> Host: beta-newsroom.lds.org<br />
> Accept: */*<br />
> Accept-Encoding: deflate, gzip<br />
</code></p>
<p>and gets back a response of:</p>
<p><code><br />
< HTTP/1.1 200 OK
< Content-type: text/html; charset=utf-8
< Server: MarkLogic
< Content-Length: 33232
< Proxy-Connection: Keep-Alive
< Connection: Keep-Alive
< Age: 9064
< Date: Fri, 24 Sep 2010 05:07:27 GMT
</code></p>
<p>The raw HTML is 33,232 bytes.  The compressed version of the HTML is 8,549 bytes.  An easy way to trim the page size by 24,683 bytes.  I'd be surprised if their web server (MarkLogic) doesn't support compression, so this is likely a simple configuration change some where.</p>
<p>Going done the list of easily compressed resources:</p>
<ul>
<li>http://beta-newsroom.lds.org/assets/styles/screen.css - 105,478 bytes, 16,689 compressed, saves 88,789 bytes</li>
<li>http://beta-newsroom.lds.org/assets/scripts/jquery-1.4.min.js - 69,838 bytes, 23,666 compressed, saves 46,172 bytes</li>
<li>http://beta-newsroom.lds.org/assets/scripts/common.js - 19,574 bytes, 5,080 compressed, saves 14,494 bytes</li>
<li>http://beta-newsroom.lds.org/assets/scripts/jquery.cycle.all.min.js - 23,729 bytes, 7,122 compressed, saves 16,607 bytes</li>
<li>http://beta-newsroom.lds.org/assets/videos/uvp/scripts/swfobject.js - 21,543 bytes, 4,728 compressed, saves 16,815 bytes</li>
<li>https://secure.lds.org/stats/s_code_ldsall.js - 31,543 bytes, 12,415 compressed, saves 19,128 bytes</li>
</ul>
<p>On a fully loaded page that weighs over 600KB turning on compression support for these 7 items would reduce it by 226,688 bytes.  </p>
<p>The https://secure.lds.org/stats/s_code_ldsall.js file is servered by a different web server, Netscape-Enterprise/4.1, which is fairly old.  I'm not sure if it even properly supports compression.  If not throwing a caching server (nginx, varnish, squid, etc.) in front would do the trick.</p>
<p>Another method for reducing the file sizes is minifying the CSS and Javascript (in some cases this is being done already).</p>
<h3>Blocking</h3>
<p>Loading all of that Javascript at the top of the page is causing other downloads to block.  As a result the site doesn't start to render until we are more than a second into the page.  This is a good place to remember the rule of thumb: load CSS as early as possible and Javascript as late as possible.</p>
<p>There is one block of inline Javascript in the page, but it is at the very bottom.</p>
<p>For the most part there doesn't appear to be too many places where parallel downloads are blocked.  One thing that could be done to improve parallel downloads though is to spread out more of the resources across different host names.</p>
<h3>Images</h3>
<p>The page loads 51 images, totaling 248KB.  The <a href="http://www.webpagetest.org/result/100924_5TGG/1/pagespeed/">Page Speed results</a> indicates that these could be optimized to reduce their size by 104KB.</p>
<p>Serving images (and other static content) from another domain would also cut down on cookie data sent back for each request.</p>
<h3>Caching</h3>
<p>Here is another area that I was really surprised by, the bulk of those images don't provide cache headers.  As a result browsers will re-download those images for each page load through out the site.  The <a href="http://www.webpagetest.org/result/100924_5TGG/1/details/cached/">repeat view waterfall chart</a> should be much smaller, no need to fetch all those images on every page view.</p>
<p>Throwing in some Last-Modified and ETag headers will clear that up.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>There are some other techniques that could be employed to help speed things up, but they depend heavily on how the site is developed and deployed.  There is already enough low hanging fruit to make a big difference.</p>
<p>I think you could conservatively target the total size for the page at less than 300KB.  This would reduce the amount of data transmitted to browsers by more than 50%.  Another benefit is the time it takes for the page to fully load.  Currently it is right at 2.5 seconds.  Something closer to 1.5 seconds seems reasonable.  With proper caching headers return visitors could see times under 1 second.</p>
<p>All of this was just for the front page of the site.  I haven't looked at any other pages on the site, but I suspect that they'd benefit from the same items listed above.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://familysearch.org/">FamilySearch.org</a> posted some interesting information recently.</p>
<p>First up, <a href="http://library.fsbeta.familysearch.org/node/861">videos about the Granite Mountain Records Vault</a>:</p>
<a href="/2010/07/23/familysearch-granite-mountain-records-vault-indexing/"><img src="/wp-content/plugins/wp-youtube-lyte/lyteCache.php?origThumbUrl=%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FMfXVvWb0qOQ%2Fhqdefault.jpg" alt="YouTube Video"></a><br /><br /></p>

<p>The vault is in Little Cottonwood Canyon, about 15 minutes from my house.  Too bad they don&#8217;t do tours, I&#8217;d love to see that in person.</p>
<p>One hundred years initially to scan all of those images, ouch!  Bringing that number down to ten is huge.  Even at ten years though, that is a tremendous amount of work.  Talk about your large data sets.  I wonder if they produce graphs of the data size over time.  No matter how you look at it, that is an amazing challenge.</p>
<p>And if catching up with the already collected data isn&#8217;t enough, more is coming in every day.  The <a href="http://indexing.familysearch.org/">indexing project</a> has added <a href="http://library.fsbeta.familysearch.org/node/862">100 million new records during the first half of 2010</a> and expects to hit 200 million by the end of the year.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s neat to see all this data come online.  Somethings I can&#8217;t figure out though, like why <a href="http://pilot.familysearch.org/">http://pilot.familysearch.org/</a> is done entirely in Flash.  They appear to have recreated HTML using Flash, with less usability.  Yuck!  It&#8217;s 2010, I know you can do better than that!</p>
<p>And what&#8217;s up with those crazy URLs, <a href="http://blog.fsbeta.familysearch.org/node/861">http://blog.fsbeta.familysearch.org/node/861</a>?  Friendly URLs are good for people and search engines.  No reason for a blog not to have friendly URLs; the first post on blog.fsbeta.familysearch.org is January 2009, well after pretty much everyone else figured this out already.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>During the October 2009 General Conference of <a href="http://lds.org/">The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints</a> Elder D. Todd Christofferson gave a talk titled <a href="http://www.lds.org/conference/talk/display/0,5232,23-1-1117-34,00.html">Moral Discipline</a>.  I&#8217;ve listened to it and read it several times now, it&#8217;s a great commentary on why a society is much better off if individuals choose to be good on their own instead of trying to rely on outside forces (like governments) to compel people to be good.  Here are a few choice quotes (emphasis mine):</p>
<blockquote><p>
The societies in which many of us live have for more than a generation failed to foster moral discipline. They have taught that truth is relative and that everyone decides for himself or herself what is right. Concepts such as sin and wrong have been condemned as “value judgments.” As the Lord describes it, “Every man walketh in his own way, and after the image of his own god” (<a href="http://scriptures.lds.org/en/dc/1/16#16">D&amp;C 1:16</a>).</p>
<p>As a consequence, self-discipline has eroded and societies are left to try to maintain order and civility by compulsion. <b>The lack of internal control by individuals breeds external control by governments.</b> One columnist observed that “gentlemanly behavior [for example, once] protected women from coarse behavior. Today, we expect sexual harassment laws to restrain coarse behavior. . . .</p>
<p>“Policemen and laws can never replace customs, traditions and moral values as a means for regulating human behavior. At best, the police and criminal justice system are the last desperate line of defense for a civilized society. Our increased reliance on laws to regulate behavior is a measure of how uncivilized we’ve become.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>Having a good and decent society starts one person at a time.  In the grand scheme of things I&#8217;m unlikely to have a large scale impact for good, but hopefully I  can have a positive impact on those that I come in contact with each day.</p>
<blockquote><p>
There could never be enough rules so finely crafted as to anticipate and cover every situation, and even if there were, enforcement would be impossibly expensive and burdensome. <b>This approach leads to diminished freedom for everyone.</b>
</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;ve tried to explain this concept in other circumstances before.  It feels like those who want a precise list of everything that would be considered right or wrong are looking for ways to do bad things while being able to fall back on the excuse of it not being on the list.</p>
<blockquote><p>
We cannot presume that the future will resemble the past—that things and patterns we have relied upon economically, politically, socially will remain as they have been. Perhaps our moral discipline, if we will cultivate it, will have an influence for good and inspire others to pursue the same course. We may thereby have an impact on future trends and events. <b>At a minimum, moral discipline will be of immense help to us as we deal with whatever stresses and challenges may come in a disintegrating society.</b>
</p></blockquote>
<p>Do the right thing, life is less stressful that way <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>If you have a few minutes go read the <a href="http://www.lds.org/conference/talk/display/0,5232,23-1-1117-34,00.html">whole thing</a>.</p>
