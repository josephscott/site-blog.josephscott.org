Tagging data (URLs, images, etc) has impressed a lot of people as a &#8220;better way&#8221; to organize content.  Normally when having these types of discussions you point to <a href=\"http://del.icio.us\">del.icio.us</a>, <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/\">Flickr</a> and more recently <a href=\"http://www.technorati.com\">Technorati</a>.  Today a new, much larger, player is added to that list, <a href=\"http://www.yahoo.com\">Yahoo!</a>.  Their <a href=\"http://www.ysearchblog.com/archives/000130.html\">announcement about My Web 2.0</a> emphasizes that the reasoning behind this is to capitalize on the community knowledge behind allowing virtually anyone to tag websites.  JeremY! has some <a href=\"http://jeremy.zawodny.com/blog/archives/004859.html\">thoughts</a> on why this is important.</p>\n<p>My first impression is that this looks pretty darn cool!  Go start at <a href=\"http://myweb2.search.yahoo.com/\">http://myweb2.search.yahoo.com/</a> (assuming your have a Yahoo! account already) and simply do some searches on the web and start tagging them.  You do this via the &#8220;Save&#8221; link for the site in the search results page.  When you save a link it asks your for a description and tags, with the tags field providing suggestions (presumably from tags that other people are using).  Permissions can be set to restrict this to just yourself, your community or everyone.  Another feature I don&#8217;t remember seeing before is the &#8220;View as XML&#8221; link.  It turns out that Yahoo! is identifying RSS/ATOM feeds and then providing a link.  So if a site as the &#8220;View as XML&#8221; link on it in the search results, you know it has a feed.  Nice to see search engines trying to divine what features sites have a do something with that knowledge.</p>\n<p>You can import an existing list of links from IE, Yahoo! Bookmarks or and RSS feed.  Although I haven&#8217;t tried it yet, I suspect you&#8217;ll be able to import your del.icio.us bookmarks into My Web 2.0 via the RSS import feature.  There are some other features that you&#8217;d expect from this type of service, like the top 100 most popular sites and browsing by tags.  Of course you can also search on just your own set of links.  One thing I couldn&#8217;t find was way to see how many other people had saved the same URL.  This is something that you can do in del.icio.us and it&#8217;s rather disappointing to see that left out here.  So far that is the most obvious feature that is missing.  I should note here that so far the site seems to respond very quickly, which is something that del.icio.us has had problems with, either being down or just extremely slow.</p>\n<p>As JeremY! noted, they&#8217;ve exposed <a href=\"http://developer.yahoo.net/myweb/index.html\">My Web 2.0 via the Yahoo Search API</a>, which was a very smart move.  In the future I&#8217;d like to see more this approach, where virtually every feature is exposed (to some degree) via an API that we can get our hands the same day a new feature is released.
