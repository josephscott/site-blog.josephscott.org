										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A question came up during a recent conversation that was along the lines of:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Who was the last person alive who was born in the 1800s?
</p></blockquote>
<p>It didn&#8217;t take long to find the Wikipedia article on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emma_Morano">Emma Morano</a>, that claims to address this exact question:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Emma Martina Luigia Morano (OMRI]) (29 November 1899 – 15 April 2017) was an Italian supercentenarian who, before her death at the age of 117 years and 137 days, was the world&#8217;s oldest living person whose age had been verified, and the last living person to have been verified as being born in the 1800s. She remains the oldest Italian person ever and the second-oldest European person ever behind Frenchwoman Jeanne Calment.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Impressive.  Looking at the list of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_oldest_living_people">oldest living people</a>, there are at least 100 people currently over the age of 110.  Based on that track record, I expect we&#8217;ll see multiple people who were born in the 1900s beyond 2110.</p>
<p>If you were born in the later half of 1999, who knows, one day you might be the last living person from the 1900s.  Some 18 year old out there better start thinking about their legacy ( and take really good notes in a journal ).</p>
