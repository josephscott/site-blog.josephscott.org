She remains the oldest Italian person ever and the second-oldest European person ever behind Frenchwoman Jeanne Calment.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Impressive.  Looking at the list of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_oldest_living_people\">oldest living people</a>, there are at least 100 people currently over the age of 110.
