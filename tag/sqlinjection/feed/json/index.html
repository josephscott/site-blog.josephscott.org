I couldn&#8217;t believe that the author was basically claiming that MySQL is more secure than <a href=\"http://www.sqlite.org/\">SQLite</a> and <a href=\"http://www.postgresql.org/\">PostgreSQL</a> because they allowed you to run multiple SQL statements in one string.  Then something else came to mind, didn&#8217;t MySQL add this feature not too long ago?  So I went hunting around and came up with the <a href=\"http://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql/en/c-api-multiple-queries.html\">C API Handling of Multiple Query Execution</a> in MySQL, which was introduced in version 4.1.  Although still correct, the <a href=\"http://us2.php.net/mysql_query\">mysql_query()</a> function in <a href=\"http://www.php.net/\">PHP</a> doesn&#8217;t allow for multiple statements, the underlying C libraries do.  I&#8217;d expect that at somepoint in the future PHP will catch up and support that feature for MySQL 4.1 and above.</p>\n<p>But back to my first point, being able to run multiple queries in a single string is not a security threat.

If you allow unfiltered data to be injected into your SQL statement then you&#8217;ve got problems, even if you database doesn&#8217;t support multiple statements in a single string.</p>\n<p>I hope that this isn&#8217;t typical of the rest of the book.</p>\n",
