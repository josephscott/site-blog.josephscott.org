										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You have likely heard of &#8220;The Golden Rule&#8221;, which is usually described as: treat other people the way that you want to be treated.  The New Testament version comes from <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/matt/7?lang=eng">Matthew 7:12</a> ( emphasis mine ):</p>
<blockquote><p>
12 <strong>Therefore all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them</strong>: for this is the law and the prophets.
</p></blockquote>
<p>While talking with others about the current political situation I thought of a version of this that could be applied specifically to politics:</p>
<blockquote><p>
<strong>Govern in the way that you would want an opposing party to govern.</strong>
</p></blockquote>
<p>That is to say that while your policies and agenda may be different, the way you go about it should be completely above board and beyond reproach.</p>
