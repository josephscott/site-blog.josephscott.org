According to the <a href=\"http://jetblue.com/about/whyyoulllike/about_whyairbusstats.html\">stats for the Airbus A320</a> the cabin height is 7 feet 1 inch.  I&#8217;m not sure if that is the actual head room in the isle, but it was higher than the top of my head and that is what counts in this case.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m 6 foot 4 inches tall so I&#8217;m used to things not really being designed with my size in mind, which made my experience on JetBlue so pleasantly surprising.  I was in the first 11 rows of the plane as well, which have a little bit extra leg room.  If I have a choice in the future I&#8217;ll be selecting JetBlue.</p>\n",
