It seems to me that this what <a href=\"http://tim.oreilly.com/\">Tim O&#8217;Reilly</a> means when using the term <a href=\"http://blogs.zdnet.com/BTL/index.php?p=1565\">Web 2.0</a>.  With open and usable APIs others are free to create entirely new &#8220;products&#8221; by mix and matching APIs from various sources.

I&#8217;m not sure, but I&#8217;d argue that API only/focused services are the way to go in the future.  Just like job specialization allows companies to scale in ways not possible before, I believe that API specialization would allow the Internet to scale in ways we&#8217;ve yet to see.  Let&#8217;s take a basic example, spell check.  Virtually anytime you use a <a href=\"http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_textarea.asp\">textarea</a> on a web page it would be helpful to offer a spell check feature.  When <a href=\"http://www.gmail.com/\">Gmail</a> offered an <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AJAX\">AJAX</a>ified spell check feature we were all impressed and wanted to use it in other places.

In part the popularity of AJAX has solved some of this problem, by providing frameworks that make adding such features to web pages easier.</p>\n<p>Going down one more layer, what actually does the spell checking?  Most languages have hooks into <a href=\"http://aspell.sourceforge.net/\">Aspell</a> that allows them to does this.  But does everyone who wants to use spell check on their website need to have Aspell installed and working with their language of choice?  Why isn&#8217;t there a central service providing a spell check API?  Why can&#8217;t they simply make use of a publicly available spell check API (via REST/SOAP/XML-RPC, etc)?  This wouldn&#8217;t have to be limited to web pages either, any application could simply talk to the spell check server and get the information it needed.</p>\n<p>There&#8217;s no reason to only have one spell check server, competition is a good thing and if one was offline for awhile then having others to fall back on would be helpful.  For that matter there&#8217;s no reason why you couldn&#8217;t have a local spell check server just for your company/office, as long at it made use of the same APIs so that client applications would be able to use as a drop in replacement.  Imagine being able to enter a URL in Microsoft Word in a settings area and have it make use of your company spell check server, how cool would that be?  For better performance caching could be done either at some local network server and/or on the client application.
