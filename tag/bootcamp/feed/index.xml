										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Apple announced a public beta of <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/bootcamp/">Boot Camp</a>, which helps you install <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/default.mspx">Windows XP</a> on your Intel based Apple hardware.  This includes drivers for graphics, networking, audio, wireless and bluetooth.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve got to get this out of my system first: This Is So Freaking Cool!  Okay, I feel better now.</p>
<p>With Boot Camp you can dual boot between Windows XP and Mac OS X.  Details are still coming out, but I&#8217;m going to guess that this contains updates to EFI to support BIOS dependent operating systems.  If that is the case then you should be able to multi-boot between other operating systems also (like <a href="http://www.freebsd.org/">FreeBSD</a> or <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a>).  Perhaps even <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/Windowsvista/">Windows Vista</a> when it is released.  If you combined this with something like <a href="http://www.mediafour.com/products/macdrive6/">Mac Drive 6</a>, which allows Windows to read/write to HFS/HFS+ (the Mac OS X file system), you&#8217;ll have a pretty reasonable setup.</p>
<p>Boot Camp will be included in the next version of Mac OS X (10.5) Leopard.  I don&#8217;t believe that a release date has been talked about yet for Leopard, but we are supposed to hear more this summer (August).  This also brings into question the rumors about <a href="http://www.macosxrumors.com/articles/2006/03/23/leopard-to-include-vmware-like-virtualisation-software/">virtualisation software being included in Leopard</a>.  How far with Apple really go with allowing/supporting other operating systems on their hardware?  As much as I&#8217;d like to see this rumor be true, part of me things that it isn&#8217;t likely that Apple as a company would be thrilled with the idea.  They have to draw the line some where on encouraging people to use non-OS X software.</p>
<p>At this point I see Boot Camp as good news for Apple and consumers.  For die hard Apple fans this won&#8217;t change anything, but it makes for one more reason for Windows users to make their next computer a Mac instead of a traditional PC.</p>
