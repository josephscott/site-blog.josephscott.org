On the other hand, HTTP/2 specifies a fast, secure, multiplexed framing protocol.  This document provides bi-directional multiplexed communication by layering WebSocket on top of HTTP/2.\n\nFrom draft-hirano-httpbis-websocket-over-http2-01.\nThe draft expired back on February 13, 2015 and I haven&#8217;t seen any other significant discussions in this area.  At this point there doesn&#8217;t appear to be any momentum to come up with a way to leverage HTTP/2 in future versions of the WebSocket protocol.",
