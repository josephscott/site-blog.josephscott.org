<p>Since you can’t know how your application is going to perform in production, you need to write your application so that it’s easy to fix performance in production.

<p>From <a href="https://josephscott.org/archives/2010/02/thinking-clearly-about-performance/">one of my favorite papers on performance</a>: <a href="http://method-r.com/papers/file/44-thinking-clearly-about-performance">Thinking Clearly About Performance</a>, by Cary Millsap.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://carymillsap.blogspot.com/">Cary Millsap</a> has a great paper out &#8211; <a href="http://method-r.com/downloads/doc_details/44-thinking-clearly-about-performance">Thinking Clearly About Performance</a>.  It has reminded me how critical details can be in measuring performance, throughput, response time, efficiency, skew and load.</p>
<p>The beauty of this paper isn&#8217;t that it has some magical new technique, quite the opposite actually.  The methods talked about are solid, fundamental approaches that can be used to methodically figure out what&#8217;s going in your system.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s only 13 pages long and is a pleasant, brisk read.  I recommend it for anyone doing software development, database administration, or system administration.</p>
