										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last night I headed over to <a href="https://twitter.com/">Twitter.com</a> to check on the recent updates to my timeline.  Near the top I noticed something a little different:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-xFBaTM4eosI/TrieDe-d5oI/AAAAAAAAAP4/HbQm91EY4HI/s536/timeline-promoted.png" title="Twitter Timeline - Promotions" class="alignnone" width="536" height="437" /></p>
<p>Subtle isn&#8217;t it?  Just in case you missed it, here is the same screenshot with a highlight of the difference:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-BPlUHrOixhg/Trie3uNd_KI/AAAAAAAAAQQ/m6QLvKoWTfU/s536/timeline-promoted-annotate.png" title="Twitter Timeline - Promotions" class="alignnone" width="536" height="437" /></p>
<p>Twitter allowed <a href="http://www.linode.com/">Linode</a> to inject an ad (effectively) into my timeline.  In Twitterspeak this ad is called a &#8216;promotion&#8217;.</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t new of course, <a href="http://blog.twitter.com/2011/07/timely-tweets-now-easier-to-see.html">Twitter has been talking about <strike>ads</strike> promoted tweets</a> for months.  This the first time I&#8217;ve ever seen it show up in my timeline though.</p>
<p><a href="https://support.twitter.com/articles/142101-what-are-promoted-tweets">Twitter says these can show up in official apps</a> as well, but when I looked my at timeline with the official Twitter iOS app I didn&#8217;t see the <strike>ad</strike> promoted tweet:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-j-8iTS6OiKg/TrieDoaf53I/AAAAAAAAAP8/GFq-tLWMtOc/s480/iphone-twitter.png" title="Twitter Timeline - iOS" class="alignnone" width="320" height="480" /></p>
<p>I have mixed feelings about Twitter injecting <strike>ads</strike> &#8216;promotions&#8217; into my timeline.  The promoted trends in the sidebar on Twitter.com weren&#8217;t a problem.  They are clearly labeled as an <strike>ad</strike> promotion, making it easy to tell the difference between real trends and <strike>ads</strike> promotions.  Most of the time I only scan my timeline, skipping the trending items entirely.</p>
<p>Timeline <strike>ads</strike> promotions are a different beast though.  The visual difference is relatively small, making it easy to miss when scanning through tweets.  If it had a clear visual difference (different background color?) I think it would be less annoying to me since I&#8217;d know what to avoid when scanning recent tweets in my timeline.</p>
<p>Despite having taken <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/company/twitter">over $1.1 billion in funding</a> there is little doubt that they&#8217;ll have to do something to increase real revenue.  I can&#8217;t help but feel that my timeline is expected to be pure though, having <strike>ads</strike> promoted tweets inline with little visual distinction is a disappointment.</p>
