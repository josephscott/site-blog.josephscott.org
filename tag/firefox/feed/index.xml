										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Safari Is Serious</h3>
<p>I&#8217;ve been dealing with the fallout of <a href="https://webkit.org/blog/category/privacy/">Safari ITP</a> ( Intelligent Tracking Prevention ) since mid-2018.  It hasn&#8217;t been an easy road, ITP dramatically limits the range of valid uses of third party cookies, and even for the remaining valid uses it required following a strict set of rules.</p>
<p>As a user of the web, I liked what ITP was doing.  As a developer, it made things difficult.  Kudos to <a href="https://twitter.com/johnwilander">John Wilander</a> on the WebKit team for taking the time to answer my questions.</p>
<p>I could see that Apple was serious about this.  While I didn&#8217;t have any inside information as to what all of the browser vendors were planning, I strongly suspected that they would have no choice but to follow suit.  I commented to a co-worker:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Remember how happy people where when browsers started blocking pop-up ads?  This could go down a similar road.
</p></blockquote>
<p>The details of ITP changed over time, as Apple saw what sites were doing with the new restrictions.  During the summer of 2019 Apple published the <a href="https://webkit.org/tracking-prevention-policy/">WebKit Tracking Prevention</a> &#8211; which made it clear that they were serious, and going to push things even further:</p>
<blockquote><p>
There are practices on the web that we do not intend to disrupt, but which may be inadvertently affected because they rely on techniques that can also be used for tracking. We consider this to be unintended impact.</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p>When faced with a tradeoff, we will typically prioritize user benefits over preserving current website practices. We believe that that is the role of a web browser, also known as the user agent.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Safari Tech Preview already has an experimental feature for disabling all third party cookies.</p>
<h3>Chrome Samesite and Firefox ETP</h3>
<p>In 2019 Chrome announced they were going to add support for a new <code>SameSite</code> cookie value: <code>None</code>.  <a href="https://web.dev/samesite-cookies-explained/">SameSite=None</a> changes how Chrome deals with third party cookies by default, but it is fairly easy for servers to add this new value and have everything work as before.</p>
<p>One additional requirement for <code>SameSite=None</code> is HTTPS.  They went back and forth on that a bit, but ultimately settled on only allowing third party tracking cookies if they were done over HTTPS with the <code>secure</code> cookie attribute.  Given how wide spread HTTPS has become, I didn&#8217;t see this as a huge shift either.</p>
<p>Both of these SameSite changes in Chrome are not scheduled to be live by default until February 2020, so we still don&#8217;t know exactly what their full impact will be.</p>
<p>A few months later Firefox <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2019/09/03/todays-firefox-blocks-third-party-tracking-cookies-and-cryptomining-by-default/">announced</a> that ETP ( Enhanced Tracking Protection ) would be enabled by default.  This approach was different from Chrome and Safari, in that they were using a <a href="https://disconnect.me/trackerprotection">list of things to block</a>.  They also expanded it beyond third party tracking to cryptomining.</p>
<p>From my point of view Chrome and Firefox were both making moves in the right direction, but none of them were as big as Safari.</p>
<h3>Then Chrome Goes Nuclear</h3>
<p>Because Google makes so much money from ads, and they are able to do that in part because they track you every where, many people thought that Chrome would never get super serious about reducing the power of third party tracking.  That all changed this week:</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/justinschuh/status/1217115664277803011"><img loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/chrome-cookie-tweet-1024x754.png" alt="" width="580" height="427" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-17976" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/chrome-cookie-tweet-1024x754.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/chrome-cookie-tweet-300x221.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/chrome-cookie-tweet-768x566.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/chrome-cookie-tweet-1200x884.png 1200w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/chrome-cookie-tweet.png 1252w" sizes="(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px" /></a></p>
<p>If Safari ITP was waging a war on third party tracking, then Chrome announced they were hitting the nuclear option: <a href="https://blog.chromium.org/2020/01/building-more-private-web-path-towards.html">Building a more private web: A path towards making third party cookies obsolete</a>.  The quote from their announcement that is getting all the attention is:</p>
<blockquote><p>
&#8230; we plan to phase out support for third-party cookies in Chrome. Our intention is to do this within two years.
</p></blockquote>
<p>No more third party cookies.  Let that sink in for a minute.</p>
<p>Chrome is the <a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/">most used browser in the world</a> ( it isn&#8217;t even close ), a change like this is going to impact everyone on the web.  It is so big that there are going to be ramifications I haven&#8217;t even thought of yet.</p>
<p>I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if Safari comes out and says they are going to do the same thing.  If they do, I would expect them to have an even more aggressive timeline.  My guess: by the end of 2020.</p>
<h3>The Clock Is Ticking</h3>
<p>Now is the time to figure this out, it isn&#8217;t going to be any easier later on.</p>

On the client side, <a href="http://bitsup.blogspot.com/2015/09/brotli-content-encoding-for-firefox-44.html">Firefox is aiming to add support for Brotli in version 44</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
If all goes well in testing, Firefox 44 (ETA January 2016) will negotiate brotli as a content-encoding for https resources. The negotiation will be done in the usual way via the Accept-Encoding request header and the token &#8220;br&#8221;. Servers that wish to encode a response with brotli can do so by adding &#8220;br&#8221; to the Content-Encoding response header. Firefox won&#8217;t decode brotli outside of https &#8211; so make sure to use the HTTP content negotiation framework instead of doing user agent sniffing.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Chrome has <a href="https://www.chromestatus.com/features/5420797577396224">Brotli support listed as &#8220;in development&#8221;</a>.  I didn&#8217;t see any indication of a current timeline for it showing up in a release version.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Google announced that <a href="http://chrome.blogspot.com/2015/11/updates-to-chrome-platform-support.html">Chrome is ending support for older versions of Windows and Mac OS X</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Today, we’re announcing the end of Chrome’s support for Windows XP, as well as Windows Vista, and Mac OS X 10.6, 10.7, and 10.8, since these platforms are no longer actively supported by Microsoft and Apple. Starting April 2016, Chrome will continue to function on these platforms but will no longer receive updates and security fixes.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Dropping Windows XP support isn&#8217;t a surprise, and even Windows Vista is now 9 years old.</p>
<p>What I didn&#8217;t see coming was how quickly they dropped support for Mac OS X releases.  I&#8217;ve got an older Mac system that can&#8217;t be updated past 10.7, but it runs fine and still gets reasonable use.  Then there is 10.8, which is only 3 years old.  That would be the equivalent of dropping support for Windows 8 ( and Windows Server 2012 ).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/42.0/system-requirements/">Firefox 42</a> still supports Windows XP and Mac OS X 10.6.  Looks like it will become the browser of choice for older systems.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Recently <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/">Firefox</a> has been pushing a more aggressive upgrade schedule.  There is little doubt that they are feeling the pressure from <a href="http://www.google.com/chrome">Google Chrome</a>, which is becoming increasingly popular and has an aggressive upgrade cycle as well.</p>
<p>In the <a href="http://gs.statcounter.com/#browser-ww-monthly-201009-201108">last year Chrome has become nearly as popular as Firefox</a>.  Many of the recent changes with Firefox, like the shorter release cycles, make it look like it is trying to play catch up with Chrome.  Perhaps desperately so.  Unfortunately with <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/7.0/releasenotes/">release of Firefox 7</a> it appears they are also desperate to copy the same mistakes Chrome has made.</p>
<p>It is no secret that <a href="http://josephscott.org/archives/2010/09/chrome-how-being-clever-is-worse-than-being-simple/">I really don&#8217;t like the way Chrome broke copy and paste in the URL field</a>.  That was a horrible decision that irritates me on an almost daily basis.  When I select something to be copied I expect to have an exact copy of what was selected, altering that under the hood completely breaks the concept of copy and paste.</p>
<p>So guess what new &#8220;feature&#8221; was added to <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/7.0/releasenotes/">Firefox 7</a>?  You got it:</p>
<blockquote><p>
The &#8216;http://&/#8217; URL prefix is now hidden by default
</p></blockquote>
<p>And it behaves in exactly the same broken way that Chrome does.  </p>
<p>To the Mozilla team: look, I understand that you&#8217;re concerned about losing market share to Chrome, but please, please, please don&#8217;t mimic their mistakes.  Now in order to copy and paste the URL properly I have to copy everything but the first character of the hostname, then manually type in that first character then paste in the remainder.  Absolutely horrible.  This is one feature of Chrome that no one should ever copy, and I&#8217;d be thrilled to see it removed from Chrome as well.</p>
<p>If you want to no longer show &#8216;http://&/#8217; in the URL field, fine, but please stop breaking copy and paste.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Turns out Firefox has an option for disabling this &#8220;feature&#8221; ( <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/ozh/status/118775509990637568">kudos to @ozh</a> ):</p>
<ul>
<li>Enter about:config in the URL field</li>
<li>Filter on browser.urlbar.trimURLs</li>
<li>Set the value for browser.urlbar.trimURLs to false</li>
</ul>
<p>Not great that this is on by default, but at least there is an easy way to turn it off.  Now, if only it were that easy to turn off this &#8220;feature&#8221; in Chrome.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[When using CSS border radius I&#8217;ve always specified the radius in pixels (px), something like this: [sourcecode lang=&#8221;css&#8221;] .round-box { border-radius: 5px; -moz-border-radius: 5px; -webkit-border-radius: 5px; } [/sourcecode] This got me to wondering, does it support percentages as well? So I tried this: [sourcecode lang=&#8221;css&#8221;] .round-box { border-radius: 5%; -moz-border-radius: 5%; -webkit-border-radius: 5%; } [/sourcecode] [&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When using CSS border radius I&#8217;ve always specified the radius in pixels (px), something like this:</p>
<p>[sourcecode lang=&#8221;css&#8221;]<br />
.round-box {<br />
    border-radius: 5px;<br />
    -moz-border-radius: 5px;<br />
    -webkit-border-radius: 5px;<br />
}<br />
[/sourcecode]</p>
<p>This got me to wondering, does it support percentages as well?  So I tried this:</p>
<p>[sourcecode lang=&#8221;css&#8221;]<br />
.round-box {<br />
    border-radius: 5%;<br />
    -moz-border-radius: 5%;<br />
    -webkit-border-radius: 5%;<br />
}<br />
[/sourcecode]</p>
<p>This worked in Firefox 3.6 but not in Chrome.  Some searching around revealed the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/CSS:-moz-border-radius">Mozilla -moz-border-radius</a> page.  For border radius it specifically mentions that it supports <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/CSS/length">length units</a> as well as percentages:</p>
<blockquote><p>
A percentage, relative to the width of the box (the percentage is relative to the width even when specifying the radius for a height).
</p></blockquote>
<p>That page also mentioned support for elliptical borders.  To do that you add another radius value separated by a slash:</p>
<p>[sourcecode lang=&#8221;css&#8221;]<br />

<p>The elliptical border worked on Chrome as well.  If you bend this tight enough you can get pretty close to a circle.</p>
<p>I wanted Internet Explorer to add support for border radius before; now that I&#8217;ve got even more radius toys to play with I&#8217;m practically begging.  I&#8217;m sorry Internet Explorer users but I&#8217;m tired of various border hacks when there are simple and clean CSS methods available.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There&#8217;s been a lot of talk about <a href="http://www.spreadfirefox.com/5years/en-US/">Firefox turning 5 years old</a> today.  Seems like a good time to take a look at web browser market share.  One place for this data is the <a href="http://gs.statcounter.com/">Global Stats page for StatCounter.com</a>.</p>
<h3>Top 5 Browers</h3>
<figure style="width: 500px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://gs.statcounter.com/#browser-ww-monthly-200810-200911"><img loading="lazy" alt="" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2759/4091766020_556d018a25.jpg" width="500" height="293" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Top 5 Browsers, Bar Chart</figcaption></figure>
<p>Internet Explorer has 57.15%, Firefox 32.03% and then a virtual three way tie between Chrome (4.46%),  Safari (3.58%), and Opera (2%).  Here&#8217;s the bart chart version of this graph:</p>
<figure style="width: 500px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://gs.statcounter.com/#browser-ww-monthly-200810-200911-bar"><img loading="lazy" alt="" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2781/4091000499_1e7e32dcd5.jpg" width="500" height="323" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Top 5 Browsers, Line Chart</figcaption></figure>
<h3>Browser Versions</h3>
<figure style="width: 500px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://gs.statcounter.com/#browser_version-ww-monthly-200810-200911"><img loading="lazy" alt="" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2768/4091766232_5aa1a548a0.jpg" width="500" height="293" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Browser Versions, Line Chart</figcaption></figure>
<p>IE 7 at 22.73%, IE 8 at 19.46%, Firefox 3.5 at 19.32%, IE 6 at 14.94% (<b>Ug!</b>), Firefox 3.0 at 11.22%, Safari 4.0 at 3% and Firefox 2.0 at 1.28%.  Everything else is below 1%.  Here&#8217;s the bar chart version:</p>
<figure style="width: 500px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://gs.statcounter.com/#browser_version-ww-monthly-200810-200911-bar"><img loading="lazy" alt="" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2717/4091000669_aa67dc597d.jpg" width="500" height="323" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Browser Versions, Bar Chart</figcaption></figure>
<p>The good news is that IE 7, IE 8 and Firefox 3.0+ accounts for 72% of the browser market.  The bad news is that IE 6 is still holding on at nearly 15%.</p>
<p>It would be great it other stats services like <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/">Google Analytics</a> and <a href="http://www.quantcast.com/">Quantcast</a> offered this view on the global browser market.  Matt posted some <a href="http://en.blog.wordpress.com/2009/11/09/happy-birthday-firefox/">browser stats for WordPress.com</a>, which gets a pretty wide audience.</p>
<p>The only real browser stats that matter of course are the ones for your own site.  Here&#8217;s the browser stats for josephscott.org (from Google Analytics):</p>
<figure style="width: 500px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/josephscott/4091103489/"><img loading="lazy" alt="" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2700/4091103489_9556a26807.jpg" width="500" height="152" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Browser Stats - josephscott.org</figcaption></figure>
<p>Firefox at 58.34%, IE at 19.86%, Safari at 10.70%, and Chrome at 6.92%.  The really good news is that IE 6 accounts for less than 4%.  Here&#8217;s the breakdown for operating systems:</p>
<figure style="width: 500px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/josephscott/4091897820/"><img loading="lazy" alt="" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2756/4091897820_da0e1ae1fa.jpg" width="500" height="136" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Operating System - josephscott.org visitors</figcaption></figure>
<p>Windows at 70.75%, Mac at 20.94%, and Linux at 7%.  Out of the Windows users XP accounts for 65.33%, Vista 27.59%, NT (Seriously?) 4.84%, and Server 2003 at 1.52%.  That&#8217;s a lot higher percentage for Mac and Linux than <a href="http://gs.statcounter.com/#os-ww-monthly-200810-200911">StatCounter Global Stats</a>, which isn&#8217;t too surprising considering my blog posts skew more towards Mac and open source topics.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A recent Think Vitamin article, <a href="http://carsonified.com/blog/dev/the-definitive-guide-to-get-vs-post/">The Definitive Guide to GET vs POST</a>, mentioned something that I hadn&#8217;t seen before about XMLHttpRequest (XHR).  Their Rule #4 states:</p>
<blockquote><p>
When using XMLHttpRequest, browsers implement POST as a two-step process (sending the headers first and then the data). This means that GET requests are more responsive – something you need in AJAX environments.
</p></blockquote>
<p>The claim is that even the smallest XHR will be sent using two packets if the request is done over HTTP POST instead of HTTP GET.  I don&#8217;t remember ever having heard this claim before.</p>
<p>Let me first say that performance issues for POST vs. GET probably shouldn&#8217;t be your top factor for deciding which one to use.  Make sure that you understand the implications of each and pick the right method for your request.  For most people I suspect the biggest factor will involve caching, not performance.  I was going to leave a comment on the article about this, but <a href="http://carsonified.com/blog/dev/the-definitive-guide-to-get-vs-post/#comment-13698">Simon beat me to it</a>.</p>
<p>I wasn&#8217;t the only one who wanted to find out more about XHR POST using multiple packets.  Fortunately someone else already <a href="http://carsonified.com/blog/dev/the-definitive-guide-to-get-vs-post/#comment-13556">asked that question</a> and the author <a href="http://carsonified.com/blog/dev/the-definitive-guide-to-get-vs-post/#comment-13569">replied</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
2. My claim is based on research done by Iain Lamb, cofounder of the Oddpost webmail startup that was acquired by Yahoo! and eventually became the basis for the all-new Yahoo! Mail.</p>
<p>His research showed “rather baffling finding: POST requests, made via the XMLHTTP object, send header and body data in separate tcp/ip packets [and therefore,] xmlhttp GET performs better when sending small amounts of data than an xmlhttp POST.”</p>
<p>That is why Yahoo includes the use of GET instead of POST as one of their high performance speed optimisation rules.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Simon Willison did some looking around and <a href="http://simonwillison.net/2009/Aug/18/performance/#comments">found more links for this</a>.  It was mentioned <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/performance/rules.html">here</a> and <a href="http://yuiblog.com/blog/2007/03/01/performance-research-part-3/#comment-59531">here</a>, so it looks like <a href="http://lamb.cc/">Iain Lamb</a> did do this research, even though I couldn&#8217;t find a first person account of it.  This was enough information to make me curious, but not enough to answer all of my questions.  It was time to run some tests of my own.</p>
<p>So I updated my install of <a href="http://www.wireshark.org/">Wireshark</a> on Windows XP, turned off all of the packet reassembly options for HTTP decoding and started testing browsers.  My very simple XHR POST test page looked like this:</p>
<p>[sourcecode lang=&#8221;html&#8221;]<br />
&lt;button type=&quot;button&quot; onclick=&quot;$.post(&#8216;hello.txt&#8217;, {name: &#8216;Joseph&#8217;})&quot;&gt;XHR POST&lt;/button&gt;<br />
&lt;script src=&quot;http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.3.2/jquery.min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;<br />
[/sourcecode]</p>
<p>When the button is clicked an XHR POST request is made to hello.txt with the name=Joseph for a tiny amount of data.  The domain I tested on sent along some cookies as well, but still left enough room for the tiny POST payload to fit in a single TCP packet.</p>
<p>Here are the results of the tests that I ran:</p>
<ul>
<li>IE 6 &#8211; 2 packets</li>
<li>IE 7 &#8211; 2 packets</li>
<li>IE 8 &#8211; 2 packets</li>
<li><b>Firefox 3.0.13 &#8211; 1 packet</b></li>
<li><b>Firefox 3.5.2 &#8211; 1 packet</b></li>
<li>Opera 9.27 &#8211; 2 packets</li>
<li>Safari 4.0.3 &#8211; 2 packets</li>
<li>Chrome 2.0.172.43 &#8211; 2 packets</li>
</ul>
<p>The short version of this is pretty easy to see, all of the browsers except for Firefox will use at least 2 packets for an XHR done over HTTP POST.  When I saw that Safari sent 2 packets I figured that Chrome would as well, but I tested it anyway just to make sure.</p>
<p>I looked at the data size of each packet in IE 6; the first packet had 575 bytes of data and the second packet had 11 bytes of data.  This lined up with the POST request which indicated that the content length was 11 bytes.  The second packet consisted only of the POST data.  Because Firefox sent less data in the user-agent string I increased the POST data so that it would exceed the combined total of the two IE packets to make sure I wasn&#8217;t running into any odd packet fragmentation.  The second packet in Opera, Safari and Chrome was also only the 11 bytes of POST data.</p>
<p>If this were <a href="http://dsc.discovery.com/fansites/mythbusters/mythbusters.html">Myth Busters</a> I&#8217;d call this myth confirmed.  While it is true that not ALL browsers will always use two packets, it appears that the two packet process is the rule, not the exception.  And with <a href="http://gs.statcounter.com/#browser-ww-monthly-200807-200908">IE still the most widely used browser</a> it&#8217;s very likely that a large portion of your users fall into the two packet category.  If on the other hand 95% of your users happen to be using Firefox, then sure, you can skip thinking about this.</p>
