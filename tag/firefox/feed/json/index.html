Here&#8217;s the browser stats for josephscott.org (from Google Analytics):\nBrowser Stats - josephscott.org\nFirefox at 58.34%, IE at 19.86%, Safari at 10.70%, and Chrome at 6.92%.  The really good news is that IE 6 accounts for less than 4%.  Here&#8217;s the breakdown for operating systems:\nOperating System - josephscott.org visitors\nWindows at 70.75%, Mac at 20.94%, and Linux at 7%.  Out of the Windows users XP accounts for 65.33%, Vista 27.59%, NT (Seriously?) 4.84%, and Server 2003 at 1.52%.  That&#8217;s a lot higher percentage for Mac and Linux than StatCounter Global Stats, which isn&#8217;t too surprising considering my blog posts skew more towards Mac and open source topics.",
