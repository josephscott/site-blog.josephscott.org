										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last month I linked to the <a href="https://josephscott.org/archives/2014/09/ping-of-death-history/">history of the ping of death</a>.  Going back further, we have &#8220;<a href="http://ftp.arl.mil/mike/ping.html">The Story of the PING Program</a>&#8220;:</p>
<blockquote><p>
My original impetus for writing PING for 4.2a BSD UNIX came from an offhand remark in July 1983 by Dr. Dave Mills while we were attending a DARPA meeting in Norway, in which he described some work that he had done on his &#8220;Fuzzball&#8221; LSI-11 systems to measure path latency using timed ICMP Echo packets.</p>
<p>In December of 1983 I encountered some odd behavior of the IP network at BRL. Recalling Dr. Mills&#8217; comments, I quickly coded up the PING program, which revolved around opening an ICMP style SOCK_RAW AF_INET Berkeley-style socket(). The code compiled just fine, but it didn&#8217;t work &#8212; there was no kernel support for raw ICMP sockets! Incensed, I coded up the kernel support and had everything working well before sunrise. Not surprisingly, Chuck Kennedy (aka &#8220;Kermit&#8221;) had found and fixed the network hardware before I was able to launch my very first &#8220;ping&#8221; packet. But I&#8217;ve used it a few times since then. *grin* If I&#8217;d known then that it would be my most famous accomplishment in life, I might have worked on it another day or two and added some more options.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I like that <a href="https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=ping&#038;apropos=0&#038;sektion=0&#038;manpath=FreeBSD+10.0-RELEASE&#038;arch=default&#038;format=html#end">the ping man page for FreeBSD still mentions Mike Muuss</a>.</p>
