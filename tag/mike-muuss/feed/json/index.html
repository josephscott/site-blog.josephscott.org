The code compiled just fine, but it didn&#8217;t work &#8212; there was no kernel support for raw ICMP sockets! Incensed, I coded up the kernel support and had everything working well before sunrise. Not surprisingly, Chuck Kennedy (aka &#8220;Kermit&#8221;) had found and fixed the network hardware before I was able to launch my very first &#8220;ping&#8221; packet.
