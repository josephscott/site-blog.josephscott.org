										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Back in the 90s when I worked for a small ISP in Modesto, where I did a little bit of everything, including tech support.  There were many people still using Windows 3.x, and virtually 100% of them used <a href="http://www.trumpet.com.au/index.php/downloads/trumpet-products.html">Trumpet Winsock</a> (Microsoft did have a TCP/IP stack for Windows 3.x, but I don&#8217;t know of anyone who ever used it).  During my years there I spent hours upon hours helping people properly configure Trumpet Winsock so that they could connect to the Internet.</p>
<p>When I came across <a href="http://thanksfortrumpetwinsock.com/">Thanks for Trumpet Winsock, Peter Tattam</a> yesterday I was reminded of that era in my life.  I donated a small amount in appreciation for an application that most people used for free, and played a part in building up the Internet that we all enjoy today.</p>
<p>If you used Trumpet Winsock back in the day (or just want to show appreciation for an important application from an earlier time) consider donating to the author, Peter Tattam, at <a href="http://thanksfortrumpetwinsock.com/">thanksfortrumpetwinsock.com</a>.</p>
