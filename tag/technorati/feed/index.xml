										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I wasn&#8217;t really surprised when I read <a href="http://www.kottke.org/05/08/so-long-technorati">Kottke&#8217;s farewell to Technorati</a> last week.  I&#8217;ve been on the edge of giving up too, but I&#8217;m still hoping that they&#8217;ll be able to turn things around.  I get errors of one kind or another when trying to use <a href="http://www.technorati.com/">Technorati</a> more than 50% of the time I try to use their site.  Unfortunately it has only been getting worse.</p>
<p>So when I read todays <a href="http://www.technorati.com/weblog/2005/08/43.html">announcement about Technorati and Newsweek</a> I was upset at first.  It is great and all for <a href="http://www.newsweek.com/">Newsweek</a> to be bringing in <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/7681901/site/newsweek/">blog commentary on the articles</a>, this is a big step for them.  But I was ticked that Technorati, who can&#8217;t even get their site to work half of the time, is expanding their services to others instead of making the darn thing work in the first place.</p>
<p>Then it hit me, perhaps Technorati is getting a boat load of money to provide this service to Newsweek.  I mean a lot of money, in multiple shipping containers.  Hopefully this is the case, because they need some way to make their site work and I&#8217;m hoping that a metric ton of money will make that possible.  Otherwise they are going to sink futher down the drain and users will move to services that don&#8217;t return a page bragging about their site being broken because they are recieving too much traffic.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE 1:05pm 25 Aug 2005:</strong> One of the reasons I&#8217;ve continued to hold on to hope with Technorati is because <a href="http://www.sifry.com/alerts/">Dave Sifry</a> still takes the time to respond to posts like this (see the first comment).  I&#8217;m hoping that someone with that much passion for their business will find some way to make things better.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So the rumor is that <a href="http://www.yahoo.com/">Yahoo!</a> is <a href="http://www.cubicgarden.com/blojsom/blog/cubicgarden/socialsoftware/offline/?permalink=opentech2005.html">working on a Technorati killer</a> (via <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2005/07/27.html#a10761">Scoble</a>).  This was mentioned by <a href="http://jeremy.zawodny.com/blog/">JeremY!</a> at <a href="http://www.ukuug.org/events/opentech2005/">Open Tech 2005</a>.  With <a href="http://blogs.icerocket.com/">Ice Rocket searching feeds</a> with support for <a href="http://blogs.icerocket.com/tag/">tags</a> things are really getting busy in the feed search (tag:feedsearch [<a href="http://www.technorati.com/tags/feedsearch">Technorati</a>, <a href="http://blogs.icerocket.com/search?q=tag%3Afeedsearch">Ice Rocket</a>]) field.  With Yahoo! getting in the feed search game it seems like <a href="http://www.google.com/">Google</a> and <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/">Microsoft</a> will be pulled in eventually.  Perhaps one of them will buy <a href="http://www.technorati.com/">Technorati</a>?</p>
<p>I always figured that <a href="http://www.bloglines.com/">Bloglines</a> and <a href="http://www.technorati.com/">Technorati</a> seemed like an interesting merge though.</p>
