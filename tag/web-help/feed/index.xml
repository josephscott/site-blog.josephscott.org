										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.qwest.com/">Qwest</a> has started redirecting DNS queries to their own servers.  Not because I asked them to, they did it to start pushing their own search results page when DNS queries failed (like so many others have and some still do).  This new &#8220;service&#8221; is called <a href="http://www.qwest.net/web.help/">Web.Help</a>.  In order to do this they reset my DSL line this morning (which was irritating), but they did at least provide some links on what this.</p>
<p>After reading through some of their information on their new &#8220;service&#8221; I found a link indicating that I could opt out (not that I ever opted in).  I&#8217;m not sure what they were thinking here though, instead of the &#8220;opt out&#8221; taking me to a page where I could opt out, it took me to another documentation page on their new service.  I had to dig through three or four layers of &#8220;opt out&#8221; links before I got to a page that would actually turn this off.  Which of course reset my DSL connection again about 5 minutes later.  We&#8217;ll see where this ends up.</p>
<p>The search results they were showing for failed DNS queries were from <a href="http://yahoo.com/">Yahoo</a>.  I wonder if Yahoo is paying Qwest to do this.</p>
