										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve been playing with some Python recently ( I will write more about that in a future post ) and there are two things that still trip me up on a regular basis.</p>
<p>The first issue I&#8217;ve run into is following Python style ( aka <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/">PEP 8</a> ).  Honestly, I&#8217;m just not excited about putting in the work to make sure I&#8217;m following all of the guidelines.  I&#8217;d rather let the computer deal with that busy work.  Enter: <a href="https://github.com/ambv/black">Black</a>.</p>
<p>Black is &#8220;the uncompromising Python code formatter&#8221;.  While it is still listed as beta, I&#8217;ve been very happy with it so far.  I let it take care of cleaning up the various style items that I&#8217;ve missed.</p>
<p>If getting Python style just right doesn&#8217;t excite you, I recommend trying out Black.</p>
<hr />
<p>The second issue is having spaces/indentation be significant.  I finally made a small change to my Python code to adjust my Vim setup.  I add this to the top of the file:</p>
<blockquote><p>
# vim: expandtab
</p></blockquote>
<p>That tells Vim to expand a tab into spaces.</p>
<p>I still don&#8217;t think having spacing be significant in source code is a good idea.  However, the above setting has made my &#8220;editing Python code with Vim&#8221; experience less frustrating.</p>
