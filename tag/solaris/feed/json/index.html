Yep, none other than <a href=\"http://mysql.com/\">MySQL</a>.</p>\n<p>Love it or hate it, MySQL is widely used by many companies and individuals.  What I&#8217;d like to see from Sun is a MySQL cloud service that works just like your current MySQL server(s), only better.  It should scale such that I don&#8217;t have to worry about performance and replicate data sufficiently that I&#8217;ll always have access to my data.
