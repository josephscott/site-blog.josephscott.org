										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Wikipedia description of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_problem">Birthday Problem</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
In probability theory, the birthday problem or birthday paradox concerns the probability that, in a set of n randomly chosen people, some pair of them will have the same birthday. By the pigeonhole principle, the probability reaches 100% when the number of people reaches 367 (since there are 366 possible birthdays, including February 29). However, 99.9% probability is reached with just 70 people, and 50% probability with 23 people. These conclusions include the assumption that each day of the year (except February 29) is equally probable for a birthday.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Christmas time reminds me of this math oddity because of a couple I knew several years ago. They happen to have the same birthday, which is a bit unusual by itself.  But that was only half of it.  It turned out that their birthdays were both on December 25th, Christmas day.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday (21 May) was my 33rd birthday.  Thanks to <a href="http://www.google.com/">Google</a> I learned that <a href="http://www.sherlockholmesonline.org/Biography/index.htm">Arthur Ignatius Conan Doyle</a> (of Sherlock Holmes fame) and I almost share a birthday, his is today (22 May).  I missed it by one day and 114 years <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="ðŸ™‚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethernet">Ethernet</a> and I are also pretty close, if you include <a href="http://inventors.about.com/library/weekly/aa111598.htm">Robert Metcalfe&#8217;s ethernet memo</a> as it&#8217;s original birth, on 22 May 1973.  Based on that I am one day older than ethernet.</p>
<p>1973 was also the year that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNIX">Unix</a> was being rewritten in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_programming_language">C</a>.</p>
