										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you&#8217;ve ever been here before you&#8217;ll probably quickly realize that I&#8217;ve redesigned the site.  I finally took some time over a few weeks to put together my own layout.  I borrowed the feel of the layout from <a href="http://www.russellbeattie.com/notebook/">Russell Beattie</a>.  I&#8217;m not done yet, but it seems to be functional, so I figured it was better to get it up an live than to wait for it be complete/perfect.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m making more use of <a href="http://www.wordpress.org/">WordPress</a>&#8216;s page feature and several plugins to get the features that I wanted.  Here&#8217;s a list of the plugins I&#8217;m using (so far):</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.meyerweb.com/eric/tools/wordpress/wp-gatekeeper.html">WP-GateKeeper</a> to prevent comment spam.  This is a plugin that I was already using, but it is worth another mention.</li>
<li><a href="http://vapourtrails.ca/wp-keywords">Jerome&#8217;s Keywords Plugin</a>: This plugin manages tags for WP posts.  This seems to be one of the best tag plugins for WP, it certainly has a lot of documention.</li>
<li><a href="http://priyadi.net/archives/2005/03/02/wordpress-php-exec-plugin/">WordPress PHP Exec Plugin</a>: The pages feature in WP is nice, but I needed to be able to run code from within a page, this plugin has worked well for that so far.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the short term I need to get some sort search functionality going again.  Perhaps I&#8217;ll just stick with using Google for that.  I&#8217;m hoping that tagging my posts will be more useful than using the categories support in WP.</p>
