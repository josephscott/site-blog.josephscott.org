            "content_html": "<p>Wondering how Steve Jobs feels about the DRM they are required to include in music from the iTunes Music Store?  Wonder no longer: <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/hotnews/thoughtsonmusic/\">Thoughts on Music</a> by Steve Jobs.  There&#8217;s some great stuff in there (emphasis mine):</p>\n<blockquote><p>\nToday\u2019s most popular iPod holds 1000 songs, and research tells us that the average iPod is nearly full.  This means that <b>only 22 out of 1000 songs, or under 3% of the music on the average iPod, is purchased from the iTunes store and protected with a DRM</b>. The remaining 97% of the music is unprotected and playable on any player that can play the open formats.  Its hard to believe that just 3% of the music on the average iPod is enough to lock users into buying only iPods in the future.  And since 97% of the music on the average iPod was not purchased from the iTunes store, iPod users are clearly not locked into the iTunes store to acquire their music.\n</p></blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>\nThe third alternative is to abolish DRMs entirely. Imagine a world where every online store sells DRM-free music encoded in open licensable formats. In such a world, any player can play music purchased from any store, and any store can sell music which is playable on all players. This is clearly the best alternative for consumers, and Apple would embrace it in a heartbeat. <b>If the big four music companies would license Apple their music without the requirement that it be protected with a DRM, we would switch to selling only DRM-free music on our iTunes store. Every iPod ever made will play this DRM-free music.</b>\n</p></blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>\nIn 2006, <b>under 2 billion DRM-protected songs were sold worldwide by online stores, while over 20 billion songs were sold completely DRM-free  and unprotected on CDs by the music companies themselves.</b> The music companies sell the vast majority of their music DRM-free, and show no signs of changing this behavior, since the overwhelming majority of their revenues depend on selling CDs which must play in CD players that support no DRM system.\n</p></blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>\nPerhaps those unhappy with the current situation should redirect their energies towards persuading the music companies to sell their music DRM-free.  For Europeans, two and a half of the big four music companies are located right in their backyard.  The largest, Universal, is 100% owned by Vivendi, a French company.  EMI is a British company, and Sony BMG is 50% owned by Bertelsmann, a German company.  <b>Convincing them to license their music to Apple and others DRM-free will create a truly interoperable music marketplace.  Apple will embrace this wholeheartedly.</b>\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>This could be a very big day for the future on online distribution of music.  Here&#8217;s hoping that Steve is able to pull this off, I&#8217;d love to have DRM free music available from the iTunes Music Store.</p>\n",
