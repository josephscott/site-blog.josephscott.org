										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Wondering how Steve Jobs feels about the DRM they are required to include in music from the iTunes Music Store?  Wonder no longer: <a href="http://www.apple.com/hotnews/thoughtsonmusic/">Thoughts on Music</a> by Steve Jobs.  There&#8217;s some great stuff in there (emphasis mine):</p>
<blockquote><p>
Today’s most popular iPod holds 1000 songs, and research tells us that the average iPod is nearly full.  This means that <b>only 22 out of 1000 songs, or under 3% of the music on the average iPod, is purchased from the iTunes store and protected with a DRM</b>. The remaining 97% of the music is unprotected and playable on any player that can play the open formats.  Its hard to believe that just 3% of the music on the average iPod is enough to lock users into buying only iPods in the future.  And since 97% of the music on the average iPod was not purchased from the iTunes store, iPod users are clearly not locked into the iTunes store to acquire their music.
</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>
The third alternative is to abolish DRMs entirely. Imagine a world where every online store sells DRM-free music encoded in open licensable formats. In such a world, any player can play music purchased from any store, and any store can sell music which is playable on all players. This is clearly the best alternative for consumers, and Apple would embrace it in a heartbeat. <b>If the big four music companies would license Apple their music without the requirement that it be protected with a DRM, we would switch to selling only DRM-free music on our iTunes store. Every iPod ever made will play this DRM-free music.</b>
</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>
In 2006, <b>under 2 billion DRM-protected songs were sold worldwide by online stores, while over 20 billion songs were sold completely DRM-free  and unprotected on CDs by the music companies themselves.</b> The music companies sell the vast majority of their music DRM-free, and show no signs of changing this behavior, since the overwhelming majority of their revenues depend on selling CDs which must play in CD players that support no DRM system.
</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>
Perhaps those unhappy with the current situation should redirect their energies towards persuading the music companies to sell their music DRM-free.  For Europeans, two and a half of the big four music companies are located right in their backyard.  The largest, Universal, is 100% owned by Vivendi, a French company.  EMI is a British company, and Sony BMG is 50% owned by Bertelsmann, a German company.  <b>Convincing them to license their music to Apple and others DRM-free will create a truly interoperable music marketplace.  Apple will embrace this wholeheartedly.</b>
</p></blockquote>
<p>This could be a very big day for the future on online distribution of music.  Here&#8217;s hoping that Steve is able to pull this off, I&#8217;d love to have DRM free music available from the iTunes Music Store.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So <a href="http://daringfireball.net/">John Gruber (Daring Fireball)</a> takes on the <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/09/14/zune-is-here/">TechCrunch spin of Zune</a> by describing it as <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2006/09/vapor_fumes">High on Vapor Fumes</a>.  The point being mostly that until the device is actually out, ranting about how successful it will be is premature at best.</p>
<p>John ends his post with a few questions:</p>
<blockquote><p>
If they’re “not done with it yet”, on September 14, when will they be? How late can they wait to go into production and still hit shelves for the holiday season?</p>
<p>And if this really is a killer feature in a product they honestly expect to ship within the next month or two, why are they talking about it now? Why tip their hand to Apple in advance? Why blow all this media attention before people can actually fork over their money for the thing? Why not go for maximum impact with a “Here it is and you can buy one today!” debut a few weeks from now?</p>
<p>And the most important question of all: Brown?
</p></blockquote>
<p>When will they be done?  Who knows.  How late can they get it in to production to make into the holidays?  I don&#8217;t know that one either, but it may not be that important.  The telling question to me is asking that if this is so great, why talk about it now, possibly giving your competition ideas and time.  Very simple, getting it into the minds of the consumer.  If people believe that <a href="https://www.comingzune.com/">Zune</a> will be many times better than the <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipod/ipod.html">iPod</a>, they&#8217;ll put off buying a brand new iPod of the holidays and wait for the new Zune device.  Think of it as a battle for hearts and minds.</p>
<p>Microsoft may even realize that they aren&#8217;t going to make this holiday season at all and are doing this in a attempt to do nothing more than dampen iPod sales.  That scores a little too high on the over the top conspiracy meter for me, but then again Microsoft if known for releasing products late.</p>
<p>As for the brown thing, no idea.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This afternoon we were at <a href="http://www.ardenfair.com/">Arden Fair Mall</a> to pick up a couple of thing and I stopped by the <a href="http://www.apple.com/retail/ardenfair/week/20060108.html">Apple Store in the mall</a> to see if they had any of the new <a href="http://www.apple.com/macbookpro/">MacBook Pro</a>s  out to play with.  They didn&#8217;t have any so I didn&#8217;t stay there very long.  As we continued to another part of the mall we passed a group of three teenagers, one of whom was asking the others if they had seen the &#8220;cool <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipod/">iPod</a> store on the second floor&#8221;.  I realized immediately that he was talking about the Apple store.  Although the Apple stores certainly carry other items besides iPod, that was obviously what he was most interested in.  I guess this shouldn&#8217;t really come as a surprise given the iPod sales figures that Steve Jobs shared during his keynote last week.</p>
<p>Perhaps Apple should start opening smaller versions of the stores and put a big sign up front: &#8220;The iPod Store&#8221;.</p>
