										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I recently came across <a href="http://the1940census.com/">the1940census.com</a>, which is, in their own words:</p>
<blockquote><p>
&#8230; a joint initiative between <a href="http://archives.com/">Archives.com</a>, <a href="http://familysearch.org/">FamilySearch</a>, <a href="http://findmypast.com/">findmypast.com</a>, and other leading genealogy organizations, will coordinate efforts to provide quick access to these digital images and immediately start indexing these records to make them searchable online with free and open access.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Infrastructure is already in place to leverage volunteer time indexing images of the census records.</p>
<p>Like many others I&#8217;m excited to see this information available online and searchable ( for free! ).  I&#8217;ve got a few relatives that I&#8217;m hoping to find out more about, and they definitely fall into the 1940 timeline.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://familysearch.org/">FamilySearch.org</a> posted some interesting information recently.</p>
<p>First up, <a href="http://library.fsbeta.familysearch.org/node/861">videos about the Granite Mountain Records Vault</a>:</p>
<a href="/2010/07/23/familysearch-granite-mountain-records-vault-indexing/"><img src="/wp-content/plugins/wp-youtube-lyte/lyteCache.php?origThumbUrl=%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FMfXVvWb0qOQ%2Fhqdefault.jpg" alt="YouTube Video"></a><br /><br /></p>
<a href="/2010/07/23/familysearch-granite-mountain-records-vault-indexing/"><img src="/wp-content/plugins/wp-youtube-lyte/lyteCache.php?origThumbUrl=%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2Fy1OqEEbRTVw%2Fhqdefault.jpg" alt="YouTube Video"></a><br /><br /></p>
<p>The vault is in Little Cottonwood Canyon, about 15 minutes from my house.  Too bad they don&#8217;t do tours, I&#8217;d love to see that in person.</p>
<p>One hundred years initially to scan all of those images, ouch!  Bringing that number down to ten is huge.  Even at ten years though, that is a tremendous amount of work.  Talk about your large data sets.  I wonder if they produce graphs of the data size over time.  No matter how you look at it, that is an amazing challenge.</p>
<p>And if catching up with the already collected data isn&#8217;t enough, more is coming in every day.  The <a href="http://indexing.familysearch.org/">indexing project</a> has added <a href="http://library.fsbeta.familysearch.org/node/862">100 million new records during the first half of 2010</a> and expects to hit 200 million by the end of the year.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s neat to see all this data come online.  Somethings I can&#8217;t figure out though, like why <a href="http://pilot.familysearch.org/">http://pilot.familysearch.org/</a> is done entirely in Flash.  They appear to have recreated HTML using Flash, with less usability.  Yuck!  It&#8217;s 2010, I know you can do better than that!</p>
<p>And what&#8217;s up with those crazy URLs, <a href="http://blog.fsbeta.familysearch.org/node/861">http://blog.fsbeta.familysearch.org/node/861</a>?  Friendly URLs are good for people and search engines.  No reason for a blog not to have friendly URLs; the first post on blog.fsbeta.familysearch.org is January 2009, well after pretty much everyone else figured this out already.</p>
