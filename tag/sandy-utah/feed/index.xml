<p>The city of <a href="http://sandy.utah.gov/mobile/support/ios.html">Sandy, Utah has a mobile app for iOS devices</a>.  I tried it out for a few minutes this morning.  The app itself is ok, though doesn&#8217;t really look like an iOS app.  I suspect it was built with one of the multiplatform SDKs out there.</p>
<p>One of the features in the app was to report a problem.  I have a cross walk signal at a major intersection near my house that doesn&#8217;t work properly, so I used the app to report that.  The process wasn&#8217;t as smooth as it could have been, but was certainly usable.  The ultimate proof is if I hear anything back about it actually getting fixed though.</p>
<p>There are several things that could be done to improve this app, but they aren&#8217;t big enough to ruin the overall usefulness of the app.  This is a good first version of the app and for something that came out of a city government I&#8217;d call it really good.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[How did Brigham City end up ranking number one for bandwidth in Utah? It&#8217;s a small town (2000 Census lists it at 17,412) about half way between Ogden and Logan. So if a little town like that can have an average of 21Mbps how is it that down in Sandy the average is barely 8Mbps [&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>How did <a href="http://www.brighamcity.utah.gov/">Brigham City</a> end up ranking number one for <a href="http://www.netindex.com/download/3,136/Utah/">bandwidth in Utah</a>?  It&#8217;s a small town (2000 Census lists it at 17,412) <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=brigham+city+utah&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=Brigham+City,+Box+Elder,+Utah&amp;gl=us&amp;ei=5FVXTMfUNIHdnAemidTOAw&amp;ved=0CCsQ8gEwAA&amp;ll=41.510634,-112.015228&amp;spn=0.918321,1.652069&amp;z=10">about half way between Ogden and Logan</a>.  So if a little town like that can have an average of 21Mbps how is it that down in Sandy the average is barely 8Mbps (ranking 19th!)?</p>
<p>Granted all of is from numbers produced by <a href="http://speedtest.net/">Speedtest.net</a>, but the sample sizes seem reasonable enough.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure if I look hard enough I&#8217;ll find a way to blame this on Qwest.</p>
