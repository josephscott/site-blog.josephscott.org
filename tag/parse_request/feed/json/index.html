I&#8217;ll outline three different approaches on how to do this.  These aren&#8217;t new, many people have written about these; forums, blog posts, email lists and IRC.  I&#8217;m still seeing questions about this though, so I wanted to address this specific question with specific solutions.</p>\n<p>For the purposes of code examples I&#8217;ll assume that you have an option called <code>my_background_color</code> and that you want to do something like this:</p>\n<p>[sourcecode lang=&#8221;css&#8221;]<br />\nbody {<br />\n    background-color: &lt;?php echo $theme_opt[&#8216;my_background_color&#8217;]; ?&gt;<br />\n}<br />\n[/sourcecode]</p>\n<p>We&#8217;ll start with the simplest method.</p>\n<h3>header.php</h3>\n<p>Most themes have a <code>header.php</code> file that contains template code for the top of the HTML output.  This makes it easy to add custom CSS with options, just echo it out inside the HEAD section of the HTML:</p>\n<p>[sourcecode lang=&#8221;html&#8221;]<br />\n&lt;style type=&#8217;text/css&#8217;&gt;<br />\nbody {<br />\n    background-color: &lt;?php echo $theme_opt[&#8216;my_background_color&#8217;]; ?&gt;<br />\n}<br />\n&lt;/style&gt;<br />\n[/sourcecode]</p>\n<p>The advantages to this approach is that it&#8217;s very simple, you already have a <code>header.php</code> so adding a few more lines doesn&#8217;t take much work.  The disadvantage is that this solution isn&#8217;t very flexible, if you have complex rules about when and how to include the CSS then your <code>header.php</code> file gets a lot extra &#8220;stuff&#8221; that may not need for every page.</p>\n<p>If your needs are simple then this works great.  If not, I suggest using either wp_head or parse_request.</p>\n<h3>wp_head</h3>\n<p>Each theme calls a WordPress action at the end of the HTML HEAD section &#8211;  <a href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API/Action_Reference/wp_head\">wp_head</a> &#8211; that can be used to include the custom CSS:</p>\n<p>[sourcecode lang=&#8221;php&#8221;]<br />\n&lt;?php<br />\nadd_action( &#8216;wp_head&#8217;, &#8216;my_custom_css_hook&#8217; );<br />\nfunction my_custom_css_hook( ) {<br />\n    # get theme options<br />\n?&gt;</p>\n<p>&lt;style type=&#8217;text/css&#8217;&gt;<br />\nbody {<br />\n    background-color: &lt;?php echo $theme_opt[&#8216;my_background_color&#8217;]; ?&gt;<br />\n}<br />\n&lt;/style&gt;</p>\n<p>&lt;?php<br />\n}<br />\n[/sourcecode]</p>\n<p>The only real difference between this approach and the previous one is that it&#8217;s less clutter in <code>header.php</code>.
