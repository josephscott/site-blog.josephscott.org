										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week <a href='http://googlefiberblog.blogspot.com/2015/03/google-fiber-is-coming-to-salt-lake-city.html'>Google Fiber announced they are coming to Salt Lake City</a>.  It looks like this is going to be a new fiber network, built from scratch.  That is significantly different from the Google Fiber in Provo, which was done by purchasing an existing network.</p>
<p>Unfortunately there is no fiber run to my house, and as far as I know there are no plans for it in the future.  There are really only two options: CenturyLink and Comcast.  For my location CenturyLink offers a maximum speed of 12Mbps down, which is usable, but not great.  Under the <a href="http://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-finds-us-broadband-deployment-not-keeping-pace">new FCC guidelines</a> that isn&#8217;t even considered broadband.</p>
<p>Comcast does provide 50 &#8211; 100Mbps down connections.  Unfortunately that means there is effectively only one broadband connection option.</p>
<p>At this point with Google Fiber already in Provo, and Google Fiber going into Salt Lake City, they may as well build out the area between the two <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="ðŸ™‚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>ZDNet reports that <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/change-your-passwords-comcast-hushes-minimizes-serious-hack-7000026118/" title="Interesting how many attackers have used Pastebin to share details.">over 30 Comcast mail servers were compromised recently</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
NullCrew FTS used a Local File Inclusion (LFI) exploit to gain access to the Zimbra LDAP and MySQL database â€” which houses the usernames and passwords of Comcast ISP users.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I am a Comcast customer and I haven&#8217;t heard anything from them about this.  Which is line with what ZDNet has reported, that they haven&#8217;t been forth coming with details yet.</p>
<p>Off I went to change my Comcast password.  That is when I ran into this disappointing password policy:</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/comcast-password-limits-1.jpg" title="Another disappointing password policy."><img loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/comcast-password-limits-1.jpg" alt="comcast-password-limits" width="272" height="222" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9915" /></a></p>
<p>The good part is that they do support special characters, which is more than I can say for some other password policies I&#8217;ve seen.</p>
<p>The bad part is that it only supports up to 16 characters and doesn&#8217;t allow spaces.  That suggests that Comcast might be storing the passwords in plain text.  Which of course would be bad.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It isn&#8217;t every day that I get to say something nice about <a href="http://www.comcast.com/">Comcast</a>, so I&#8217;m making a point of doing that today.</p>
<p>This morning I got an email from Comcast about my cable Internet connection:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Dear Valued Customer, </p>
<p>Great news! We&#8217;ve increased your Internet speed! </p>
<p>Now we have doubled the speed of your Blast!Â® Internet service, with download speeds up to 50 Mbps and upload speeds up to 10 Mbps.
</p></blockquote>
<p>My existing connection was already 35 Mbps down, so 50 Mbps wouldn&#8217;t be double, but it definitely would be a big increase.  I was more excited about the upstream speed going from my current 6 Mbps to 10 Mbps.</p>
<p>Before doing the modem update I ran a <a href="http://www.speedtest.net/">Speedtest.net</a> test to the local Comcast test node in Salt Lake City:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://sharedat.net/f/XC/XClN/speedtest-35mbps.png" width="699" height="73" class="aligncenter" /></p>
<p>Which isn&#8217;t bad, that is up and down speeds that I&#8217;ve had for a few years.  I should also note that is from my Macbook Air connected over my home wifi network.</p>
<p>I pulled the power, cable, and ethernet connections out of the back of my cable modem, paused for a few seconds, then plugged everything back in.  After waiting about a minute the connection came back.  I ran the same Speedtest.net test again:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://sharedat.net/f/iC/iCmm/speedtest-50mbps.png" width="700" height="66" class="aligncenter" /></p>
<p>Faster speeds!  The upgrade was painless and only took a couple of minutes.  When I first signed up for Comcast I made sure to get a cable modem that supported DOCSIS 3.0, just in case.  Today that appears to have paid off.</p>
<p>Thank you Comcast.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I recently <a href="http://josephscott.org/archives/2010/11/from-qwest-dsl-to-comcast-cable/">switched to Comcast</a> at home.  Today in the mailbox I found 10 separate letters from Comcast:</p>
<figure style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" alt="Important Message From Comcast" src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1198/5169784987_8214db7ed7_z.jpg" title="Important Message From Comcast" width="640" height="480" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Important Message(s) From Comcast</figcaption></figure>
<p>No idea why they felt it was necessary to use 10 separate envelopes for this, but i figured it must be pretty important.  So I opened all 10, each contained a single piece of paper.  After quickly scanning through the text of each one there were 2 groups of letters:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>First group</strong>&#8211; one letter indicating that I had a new password for one of their services, it included the new password in the text of the letter</li>
<li><strong>Second group</strong>&#8211; nine letters indicating that I had recently changed my password for one of their services</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#8217;d call this overkill, but some how that just doesn&#8217;t seem strong enough.</p>
