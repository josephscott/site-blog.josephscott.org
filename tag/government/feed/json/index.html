This was because the data I&#8217;d found (<a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/fy2009/pdf/hist.pdf\">2009 Budget Historical Tables</a> PDF and the <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/fy2004/sheets/hist07z1.xls\">Federal Debt at the End of Year: 1940\u20132008</a> XLS) only went back to 1940.  A little more digging revealed that <a href=\"http://treasurydirect.gov/\">TreasuryDirect.gov</a> has a complete list of the <a href=\"http://www.treasurydirect.gov/govt/reports/pd/histdebt/histdebt.htm\">history of annual outstanding federal debt</a> from 1791 to today.</p>\n<p>The federal debt started at $75,463,476.52, in 1791.  It reached it&#8217;s lowest point, $33,733.05, in 1835 when Andrew Jackson was President.  Other milestones include the first time the debt passed $1 billion in 1863 under Abraham Lincoln and exceeding $1 trillion in 1982 during Ronald Reagan&#8217;s Presidency.  On the other side of the coin Woodrow Wilson was the first President to reduce the debt by more than $1 billion in a single year (1920).  The single largest reduction in the debt in a single year happened in 1947, by more than $11 billion, when Harry S. Truman was President.  Since 1791 the year over year debt has only been reduced 80 times under 29 different Presidents.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s a list of all the years that the federal debt went down, including by how much and who the President was at the time:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>1794 &#8211; $1.9 million &#8211; George Washington</li>\n<li>1797 &#8211; $1.7 million &#8211; George Washington / John Adams</li>\n<li>1798 &#8211; $2.8 million &#8211; John Adams</li>\n<li>1799 &#8211; $0.8 million &#8211; John Adams</li>\n<li>1802 &#8211; $5.9 million &#8211; Thomas Jefferson</li>\n<li>1803 &#8211; $3.6 million &#8211; Thomas Jefferson</li>\n<li>1805 &#8211; $4.1 million &#8211; Thomas Jefferson</li>\n<li>1806 &#8211; $6.5 million &#8211; Thomas Jefferson</li>\n<li>1807 &#8211; $6.5 million &#8211; Thomas Jefferson</li>\n<li>1808 &#8211; $4.0 million &#8211; Thomas Jefferson</li>\n<li>1809 &#8211; $8.1 million &#8211; Thomas Jefferson / James Madison</li>\n<li>1810 &#8211; $3.8 million &#8211; James Madison</li>\n<li>1811 &#8211; $5.1 million &#8211; James Madison</li>\n<li>1812 &#8211; $2.8 million &#8211; James Madison</li>\n<li>1817 &#8211; $3.8 million &#8211; James Madison / James Monroe</li>\n<li>1818 &#8211; $20.0 million &#8211; James Monroe</li>\n<li>1819 &#8211; $7.9 million &#8211; James Monroe</li>\n<li>1820 &#8211; $4.5 million &#8211; James Monroe</li>\n<li>1821 &#8211; $1.0 million &#8211; James Monroe</li>\n<li>1823 &#8211; $2.6 million &#8211; James Monroe</li>\n<li>1824 &#8211; $0.6 million &#8211; James Monroe</li>\n<li>1825 &#8211; $6.4 million &#8211; James Monroe / John Quincy Adams</li>\n<li>1826 &#8211; $2.7 million &#8211; John Quincy Adams</li>\n<li>1827 &#8211; $7.0 million &#8211; John Quincy Adams</li>\n<li>1828 &#8211; $6.5 million &#8211; John Quincy Adams</li>\n<li>1829 &#8211; $9.0 million &#8211; John Quincy Adams / Andrew Jackson</li>\n<li>1830 &#8211; $9.8 million &#8211; Andrew Jackson</li>\n<li>1831 &#8211; $9.4 million &#8211; Andrew Jackson</li>\n<li>1832 &#8211; $14.8 million &#8211; Andrew Jackson</li>\n<li>1833 &#8211; $17.3 million &#8211; Andrew Jackson</li>\n<li>1834 &#8211; $2.2 million &#8211; Andrew Jackson</li>\n<li>1835 &#8211; $4.7 million &#8211; Andrew Jackson</li>\n<li>1840 &#8211; $6.8 million &#8211; Martin Van Buren</li>\n<li>1844 &#8211; $9.2 million &#8211; John Tyler</li>\n<li>1845 &#8211; $7.5 million &#8211; John Tyler / James K.
