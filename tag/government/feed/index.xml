										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For 2013 I talked about <a href="https://josephscott.org/archives/2013/01/2013-shape-your-neighborhood/" title="Circular?">shaping your neighborhood</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
At a high level we make an effort to shape the type of neighborhood we live in.  It isn’t always easy (and sometimes takes a fair bit of work), but it has always been worth it.  In the coming year we are going to try and do more along the same lines, which seems to mostly involve sharing food with people who live around us.
</p></blockquote>
<p>We brought food to new neighbors, shared treats during the holidays, and shoveled a fair bit of snow.</p>
<p>In 2014 I want to expand the radius a bit.  Lets expand beyond our neighborhood and start getting more familiar with our city governments.  For me that is <a href="http://sandy.utah.gov/" title="Home">Sandy, Utah</a>.</p>
<p>In many cases you can do basic research about your city online.  Sometimes really interesting items can be found.  For example, <a href="http://www.utahsright.com/salaries.php?city=all&#038;position=MAYOR" title="Public records can be fun.">the mayor of Sandy, Utah is the highest paid mayor in the state of Utah</a>, despite only being the <a href="http://www.city-data.com/city/Utah.html#ptop" title="Nearly a tie with Orem though.">sixth largest city in the state</a>.  At $160,329 for 2013 it is more than the governor of Utah made ( $151,294 ).</p>
<p>Now for some specific goals.  For 2014 I am going to attend at least four city council meetings.  Sandy has <a href="http://www.sandynow.com/calendar.html" title="Watch your government in action.">city council meetings Tuesday at 7pm</a> most weeks ( some of them get canceled for holidays or other events ).  I will also read the <a href="http://sandy.utah.gov/fileadmin/downloads/finance/budget/Sandy_City_FY_2014_Budget.pdf" title="I wonder how many printed copies there are.">city budget</a>, which is more than 250 pages ( PDF ).  After doing those two things I&#8217;ll follow what ever interesting items come up.</p>
<p>Go watch your local government.  Find out when your city council meets and attend a few meetings.  Find a copy of your city budget and start looking at where the money is going.  If you find something interesting, follow up on it, ask questions until you get answers.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve previously mentioned that the <a href="http://josephscott.org/archives/2009/04/history-of-the-federal-debt/">last time the US federal debt went down instead of up was 1957</a>.  This came up in a conversation again recently and I started thinking about the percentage change in the federal debt for each year.  I looked at the period from 1958 to 2012, what I would call the modern era of federal debt.</p>
<p>I went back to the <a href="http://www.treasurydirect.gov/govt/reports/pd/histdebt/histdebt.htm">federal debt records</a>, they go from 1790 to today.  Dumped that data into a spreadsheet, then calculated the percentage change for each year from 1958 &#8211; 2012.  I used the all actual numbers, I didn&#8217;t attempt to normalize them to 2012 dollars since each year is just a comparison of the year before.</p>
<p>Copying that into Google Charts Javascript code generates this graph:</p>

<p>You can mouse over each point to see the exact value for any given year.</p>
<p>A few observations on this graph.  First, these are all increases, no negative numbers.  Next, you&#8217;ll easily notice that the year with the largest percentage increase was 1983, at 20.5%.  The next highest increase was 2009, at 18.8%.</p>
<p>The highs weren&#8217;t what most surprised me in this data, it was the lows.  In 2000 the percentage increase in federal debt from 1999 was only 0.32%.  That is the smallest percentage increase since 1957.  I knew that we&#8217;d reduced the yearly budget deficits during that period, but I had no idea how close we were to actually reducing the total federal debt.</p>
<p>For 2000 the dollar increase of the federal debt was $17,907,308,271.43, or roughly $18 billion ( yes, billion with a b ).  That sounds like a significant amount, but compared to other years is very small.  To give you some idea of how small, in 2001 the percentage increase was 2.35%, the dollar amount was $133,285,202,313.20, more than 7 times the amount in 2000.</p>
<p>I wanted to know more about what it would have taken to actually reduce the total debt in 2000.  The <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BUDGET-2000-BUD/html/BUDGET-2000-BUD-9.htm">2000 budget request</a> expenditures were listed as $1,765 billion.  To keep things simple I&#8217;m looking at this from the point of view of how much in spending cuts we would have needed in the 2000 budget to clear $18 billion that could have been used to reduce the total federal debt.</p>
<p>A little bit of math shows that $18 billion was 1.02% of the $1,765 billion in spending listed in the <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BUDGET-2000-BUD/html/BUDGET-2000-BUD-9.htm">proposed 2000 federal budget</a>.</p>
<p>Lets say we could find 1.1% in reductions in the budget to go towards paying down the debt.  That would get us $19.4 billion.  The first $18 billion would go to cover the increase that happened in the debt, leaving a $1.4 billion reduction in the total federal debt.  That is only a tiny fraction of the $5,674 billion total debt in 2000, but it would have been the first time in more than 40 years that it went down instead of up.</p>
<p>All totally hypothetical and vastly over simplified, but this gave me a much clearer picture of the history of the federal debt.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tired of hearing about how bad the federal debt is?  Turns out <a href="https://www.pay.gov/paygov/forms/formInstance.html?agencyFormId=23779454">you can donate money to the United States Treasury to help pay off the public debt</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Thank you for your contribution which will be deposited to the account &#8220;Gifts to Reduce the Public Debt.&#8221; Your contribution is accepted under the provisions of 31 U.S.C. 3113 which authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to accept conditional gifts to the United States for the purpose of reducing the public debt.  These donations are voluntary, and no goods, services, or other considerations are provided to the donors.
</p></blockquote>
<p>It sounds like these donations are specifically limited to only paying down the public debt.</p>
<p>As of 31 October 2011 the <a href="http://www.treasurydirect.gov/govt/reports/pd/mspd/2011/opds102011.pdf">total public debt is $14,993,709,000,000</a>.  As of the <a href="http://www.census.gov/prod/cen2010/briefs/c2010br-01.pdf">2010 Census there are 308,745,538 people in America</a>, bringing the per person amount to roughly $48,563.33.  Not exactly a trivial amount.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d be curious to know how many people donate to that account and approximately what those amounts look like.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My post about <a href="http://josephscott.org/archives/2009/03/presidents-that-have-reduced-the-federal-debt/">Presidents That Have Reduced The Federal Debt</a> was limited to data from 1940 to the present.  This was because the data I&#8217;d found (<a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/fy2009/pdf/hist.pdf">2009 Budget Historical Tables</a> PDF and the <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/fy2004/sheets/hist07z1.xls">Federal Debt at the End of Year: 1940–2008</a> XLS) only went back to 1940.  A little more digging revealed that <a href="http://treasurydirect.gov/">TreasuryDirect.gov</a> has a complete list of the <a href="http://www.treasurydirect.gov/govt/reports/pd/histdebt/histdebt.htm">history of annual outstanding federal debt</a> from 1791 to today.</p>
<p>The federal debt started at $75,463,476.52, in 1791.  It reached it&#8217;s lowest point, $33,733.05, in 1835 when Andrew Jackson was President.  Other milestones include the first time the debt passed $1 billion in 1863 under Abraham Lincoln and exceeding $1 trillion in 1982 during Ronald Reagan&#8217;s Presidency.  On the other side of the coin Woodrow Wilson was the first President to reduce the debt by more than $1 billion in a single year (1920).  The single largest reduction in the debt in a single year happened in 1947, by more than $11 billion, when Harry S. Truman was President.  Since 1791 the year over year debt has only been reduced 80 times under 29 different Presidents.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a list of all the years that the federal debt went down, including by how much and who the President was at the time:</p>
<ul>
<li>1794 &#8211; $1.9 million &#8211; George Washington</li>

<li>1957 &#8211; $2,223.6 million &#8211; Dwight D. Eisenhower</li>
</ul>
<p>There&#8217;s the complete list of every year in this country&#8217;s history where the year over year federal debt went down instead of up.</p>
<p>The debt has been reduced 36.6 percent of the time over the previous 218 years covered by this data.  Most of those reductions ( 73 percent ) happened during the 1800s.</p>
<p>Another interesting note that I hadn&#8217;t thought about until reviewing this list is that up until 1957 we had never gone more than 17 years without paying down some of the debt.  That gap was from 1930 to 1947, with a depression and war undoubtedly being major factors there.  The next largest gap was 10 years, 1857 to 1867.  The gap was normally much smaller though, with the average between 1791 and 1957 being just under 2 years.  The distribution of gaps during that time frame was: 17 years (1), 10 years (1), 6 years (3), 5 years (4), 4 years (2), 3 years (3), 2 years (7) and 1 year (57).</p>
<p>If/when we do reduce the federal debt again it will be the single largest gap between reductions in the history of this country, more than 3 times (at least) the length of the previous longest gap of 17 years.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Update &#8211; 6 Mar 2009 @ 8:05pm</strong> : <a href="http://josephscott.org/archives/2009/04/history-of-the-federal-debt/">History Of The Federal Debt</a> &#8211; I found data on the yearly federal debt amount from 1791 through present day</p>
<p>Frontline recently had an episode called <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/tentrillion/">Ten Trillion and Counting</a>, about the federal government&#8217;s debt, which is now <a href="http://www.treasurydirect.gov/NP/BPDLogin?application=np">over $11 trillion</a>.  This made me wonder, when was the last time the federal debt went down year over year?  To figure this out I looked at the <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/fy2004/sheets/hist07z1.xls">Federal Debt at the End of Year: 1940–2008</a> XLS spreadsheet.  This information is also available from the <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/fy2009/pdf/hist.pdf">2009 Budget Historical Tables</a> PDF on pages 127 and 128.</p>
<p>Since 1940 the federal debt has only dropped year over year five times: 1947 (by 13.8 billion), 1948 (by 5.1 billion), 1951 (by 1.5 billion), 1956 (by 1.6 billion) and 1957 (by 0.4 billion).  In the last 70 years we&#8217;ve only reduced the federal debt 7% percent of the time.  It&#8217;s been more than 50 years since the last time the federal debt was reduced.</p>
<p>The first three times the debt was paid down (1947, 1948 and 1951) <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/about/presidents/harrystruman/">Harry S. Truman</a> was President.  Perhaps he was serious about his <a href="http://www.trumanlibrary.org/buckstop.htm">The Buck Stops Here</a> sign.  The two most recent years the debt was reduced (1956 and 1957) were under President <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/about/presidents/dwightdeisenhower/">Dwight D. Eisenhower</a>.</p>
<p>Every President (and Congress) since 1957 has added to the federal debt.  Makes you wonder when, or if, this trend will ever turn around.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Utah, like so many other states, is trying to adapt their state budget to the current economic conditions.  In general this translates into budget shortfalls, often resulting in spending cuts and tax increases.  I recently received a flyer from Senator Wayne Niederhauser that included a survey about political priorities. Question two was:</p>
<blockquote><p>
This past year, Utah was named the &#8220;Best Managed State&#8221; by the Pew Center in <em>Governing Magazine</em>.  This recognition is a result of Utah&#8217;s proactive fiscal management and AAA bond rating (the highest rating given to States) and having over $400 million in Rainy Day Funds, a credit to Republican leadership in Utah.  In light of declining tax revenues, please list your priorities for funding from 1 to 10, with 1 being the highest priority.
</p></blockquote>
<p>That as followed by a list of options to prioritize.  The part that struck me was the $400 million plus in rainy day funds.  I was pretty impressed, a state that actually set aside money when times were good to be used when times were bad.  Many folks are now calling for these rainy day funds to be used to offset the shortfalls in the current budget.  From what I&#8217;ve been reading in the <a href="http://www.deseretnews.com/home/">Deseret News</a> (one of the major Salt Lake City newspapers, <a href="http://www.sltrib.com/">Salt Lake Tribune</a> being the other) politicians don&#8217;t seem to be very eager to make use of these rainy day funds right now.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been wondering why that is.  Maybe they are worried that they might need that money if things continue to go down hill, the idea being that the rainy day fund is a fix of last resort.  I don&#8217;t know, but I wanted to find out a bit more about what the Utah state budget looks like.  The <a href="http://governor.utah.gov/gopb/">Governor&#8217;s Office of Planning and Budget (GOPB)</a> has a budget summary PDF that looked like a good place to start.  For fiscal year 2010 the budget summary page (page 9 of 177 in the PDF) indicated that the total recommended budget for 2010 is $10.6 billion.  Utah has less than 3 million people, so the size of the state budget is relatively modest when compared with other states.</p>
<figure style="width: 500px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img loading="lazy" alt="Utah Rainy Day Fund - From 2010 Budget Summary" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3444/3304764597_88178d8de9.jpg" width="500" height="376" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Utah Rainy Day Fund - From 2010 Budget Summary</figcaption></figure>
<p>There is a chart on page 14 of the PDF showing the historic balances of the rainy day fund.  It peaked at $414 million and indicates the governor is requesting that some of that money be used to shore up the 2009 and 2010 budgets.  When looking at the $10.6 billion and $414 million next to each other I realized that the rainy day fund is really only a small percentage of the annual state budget.  How small you ask?  3.9 percent.  I was disappointed when I saw that number, the way the rainy day fund is talked up I&#8217;d hoped for something a bit more.</p>
<p>With an annual budget of $10.6 billion the rainy day fund has enough money in it to run the state for 14.3 days.  With the rainy day fund shrinking the reality is it wouldn&#8217;t even last that long.  I hope your personal budget has a rainy day fund that would at least get you through one month.</p>
<p>Of course California would kill for a rainy day fund of any size right about now <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/constitution_amendments_11-27.html#25">Amendment 25</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Section 1.<br />
In case of the removal of the President from office or of his death or resignation, the Vice President shall become President.</p>
<p>Section 2.<br />
Whenever there is a vacancy in the office of the Vice President, the President shall nominate a Vice President who shall take office upon confirmation by a majority vote of both Houses of Congress.</p>
<p>Section 3.<br />
Whenever the President transmits to the President pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives his written declaration that he is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office, and until he transmits to them a written declaration to the contrary, such powers and duties shall be discharged by the Vice President as Acting President.</p>
<p>Section 4.<br />
Whenever the Vice President and a majority of either the principal officers of the executive departments or of such other body as Congress may by law provide, transmit to the President pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives their written declaration that the President is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office, the Vice President shall immediately assume the powers and duties of the office as Acting President.</p>
<p>Thereafter, when the President transmits to the President pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives his written declaration that no inability exists, he shall resume the powers and duties of his office unless the Vice President and a majority of either the principal officers of the executive department or of such other body as Congress may by law provide, transmit within four days to the President pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives their written declaration that the President is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office. Thereupon Congress shall decide the issue, assembling within forty-eight hours for that purpose if not in session. If the Congress, within twenty-one days after receipt of the latter written declaration, or, if Congress is not in session, within twenty-one days after Congress is required to assemble, determines by two-thirds vote of both Houses that the President is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office, the Vice President shall continue to discharge the same as Acting President; otherwise, the President shall resume the powers and duties of his office.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Passed by Congress July 6, 1965. Ratified February 10, 1967.  Article II, section 1, of the Constitution was affected by the 25th amendment.</p>
<p>Outlines in greater detail the order of succession to the office of President.  If the President can also turn things over to the Vice-President if needed, which is handy if the President is going to have major surgery and be incapacitated for some period of time.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/constitution_amendments_11-27.html#26">Amendment 26</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Section 1.<br />
The right of citizens of the United States, who are eighteen years of age or older, to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of age.</p>
<p>Section 2.<br />
The Congress shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Passed by Congress March 23, 1971. Ratified July 1, 1971.  Amendment 14, section 2, of the Constitution was modified by section 1 of the 26th amendment.</p>
<p>Changes the minimum voting age to 18.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/constitution_amendments_11-27.html#27">Amendment 27</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
No law, varying the compensation for the services of the Senators and Representatives, shall take effect, until an election of representatives shall have intervened.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Originally proposed Sept. 25, 1789. Ratified May 7, 1992.</p>
<p>As I&#8217;ve noted previously, those <a href="http://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/constitution_amendment_27.html">dates are not typos</a>, it really did take more than 200 years for this amendment to be ratified.  This is also the only amendment to the Constitution to have been added in my life time.  I missed number 26 by just a few years.</p>
<h3>The Constitution, cover to cover</h3>
<p>With all of the amendments reviewed I&#8217;ve now read the entire Constitution.  It&#8217;s been an interesting experience to, filled with pleasant surprises.  And if we add any more I&#8217;ll be sure to follow up with a new post.</p>

The transportation or importation into any State, Territory, or Possession of the United States for delivery or use therein of intoxicating liquors, in violation of the laws thereof, is hereby prohibited.</p>
<p>Section 3.<br />
This article shall be inoperative unless it shall have been ratified as an amendment to the Constitution by conventions in the several States, as provided in the Constitution, within seven years from the date of the submission hereof to the States by the Congress.

<p>Passed by Congress February 20, 1933. Ratified December 5, 1933.</p>
<p>The 18th Amendment lasted nearly 15 years.  Given the culture of drinking in most of this country I&#8217;m surprised that the 18th Amendment ever passed in the first place.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/constitution_amendments_11-27.html#22">Amendment 22</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Section 1.<br />
No person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice, and no person who has held the office of President, or acted as President, for more than two years of a term to which some other person was elected President shall be elected to the office of President more than once. But this Article shall not apply to any person holding the office of President when this Article was proposed by Congress, and shall not prevent any person who may be holding the office of President, or acting as President, during the term within which this Article becomes operative from holding the office of President or acting as President during the remainder of such term.</p>
<p>Section 2.<br />
This article shall be inoperative unless it shall have been ratified as an amendment to the Constitution by the legislatures of three-fourths of the several States within seven years from the date of its submission to the States by the Congress.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Passed by Congress March 21, 1947. Ratified February 27, 1951.</p>
<p>Term limit for the President is set to 2.  Unless this changes Franklin D. Roosevelt will be the only President to have served more than 2 terms.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/constitution_amendments_11-27.html#23">Amendment 23</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Section 1.<br />
The District constituting the seat of Government of the United States shall appoint in such manner as Congress may direct:</p>
<p>A number of electors of President and Vice President equal to the whole number of Senators and Representatives in Congress to which the District would be entitled if it were a State, but in no event more than the least populous State; they shall be in addition to those appointed by the States, but they shall be considered, for the purposes of the election of President and Vice President, to be electors appointed by a State; and they shall meet in the District and perform such duties as provided by the twelfth article of amendment.</p>
<p>Section 2.<br />
The Congress shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation.

<p>Passed by Congress June 16, 1960. Ratified March 29, 1961.</p>

The Congress shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation.

<p>Passed by Congress August 27, 1962. Ratified January 23, 1964.</p>
<p>This was an effort to close loopholes that some areas has instituted to prevent parts of the population from voting.  It&#8217;s unfortunate that such a specific clause is even needed, the idea of a poll tax should have easily shot down based on the already established laws of the land.</p>
