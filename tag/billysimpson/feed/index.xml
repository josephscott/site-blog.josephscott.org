										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last Monday my brother-in-law (Sarah&#8217;s brother) Billy Simpson died in a car crash in Texas at the age of 23.  I&#8217;m not exactly sure what to say, this came as such a shock and surprise.</p>
<p>The first time I met Billy he must have been 11 or 12, when he came to live with his dad and Sarah&#8217;s mom.  He grew up to be an intelligent and athletic individual.  After high school he served an <a href="http://www.lds.org/">LDS</a> mission to Portugal.  After coming home from Portugal he joined the Air Force as a linguist.  He graduated as a Serbo-Croatian Linguist and was hoping to learn as many 10 languages.  He certainly had a gift for learning languages.</p>
<p>Take care Billy, you will be missed.  God be with you till we meet again.</p>
