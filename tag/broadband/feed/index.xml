										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Fred Wilson on <a href="http://avc.com/2015/09/a-model-for-a-competitive-broadband-market/">A Model For A Competitive Broadband Market</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
I believe the telecommunications market needs to move away from vertical integration where one provider builds, manages, and delivers the entire telecommunications stack to the market.
</p></blockquote>
<p>In theory I like the idea of having municipalities &#8220;owning&#8221; the underlying infrastructure, then allowing others to provide services on top of that.  In practical terms that broadly mean a two level stack: fiber in the ground and Internet services.</p>
<p>This appeals to the &#8220;Internet as infrastructure&#8221; view point.  Internet service at home is no longer a nice to I have, I view it in the same category as other critical services like water and electricity.</p>
<p>Competition is good for many things, and hard for some things.  When it comes to broadband, I really don&#8217;t want a different company each month ripping up the road to run fiber to a house.  Instead it makes more sense to allow central control of the fiber running to a home, then allow competition to provide services over that fiber.</p>
<hr />
<p>Unfortunately there are no fiber connections to my house, and I&#8217;m not aware of any plans to change that.</p>
