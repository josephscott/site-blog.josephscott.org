										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The William Ernest Henley poem Invictus:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Out of the night that covers me,<br />
      Black as the pit from pole to pole,<br />
I thank whatever gods may be<br />
      For my unconquerable soul.</p>
<p>In the fell clutch of circumstance<br />
      I have not winced nor cried aloud.<br />
Under the bludgeonings of chance<br />
      My head is bloody, but unbowed.</p>
<p>Beyond this place of wrath and tears<br />
      Looms but the Horror of the shade,<br />
And yet the menace of the years<br />
      Finds and shall find me unafraid.</p>
<p>It matters not how strait the gate,<br />
      How charged with punishments the scroll,<br />
I am the master of my fate,<br />
      I am the captain of my soul.
</p></blockquote>
<p>A well known and often quoted piece of poetry.</p>
<p>I was struck by the events of Henly&#8217;s life leading up to those verses.  From <a href="http://www.poetryfoundation.org/bio/william-ernest-henley">poetryfoundation.org</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
At age 12 Henley was diagnosed with tubercular arthritis that necessitated the amputation of one of his legs just below the knee; the other foot was saved only through a radical surgery performed by Joseph Lister. As he healed in the infirmary, Henley began to write poems, including “Invictus,” which concludes with the oft-referenced lines “I am the master of my fate; / I am the captain of my soul.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>Knowing more about the circumstances behind the words gives them even greater power.</p>
