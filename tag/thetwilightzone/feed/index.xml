										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve been watching the old original <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0052520/">The Twilight Zone</a> on the <a href="http://www.scifi.com/twilightzone/">SciFi Channel</a> lately.  Even after all these years most of the episodes are still great to watch.  <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0785245/">Rod Serling</a> did an awesome job as a narrator/host for the show.  Attempts to do modern versions have been tried a few times, but I don&#8217;t think that any of them have been able reach the level of efficient story telling as the original.</p>
<p>Although having the episodes in black and white are an immediate clue to their age, I can&#8217;t image ever wanting to see them <a href="http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/C/htmlC/colorization/colorization.htm">colorized</a>.  There is something pleasant about seeing these stories in their original black and white.</p>
