										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Most of have come to terms with the idea that some software come with rather evil components that try to take over Windows systems, or attack others, etc.  Usually the software packages that do this are on shaky ground to start with, are fairly easy to avoid.  I guess <a href="http://www.sony.com/">Sony</a> was looking to change all that.</p>
<p>Before you go out and buy another CD read through &#8220;<a href="http://www.sysinternals.com/blog/2005/10/sony-rootkits-and-digital-rights.html">Sony, Rootkits and Digital Rights Management Gone Too Far</a>&#8220;.  It seems that the CD &#8220;Get Right with the Man&#8221; by Van Zant will install a poorly written rootkit on your Windows system.  This is bad news, it is becoming increasingly difficult to know who to trust in these matters.  Before it was a pretty good rule of thumb that if you only installed software from reputable vendors then you&#8217;d be okay.  The list of vendors considered reputable seems to be decreasing rapidly.</p>
