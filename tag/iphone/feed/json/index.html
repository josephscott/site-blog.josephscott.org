            "content_html": "<p>There has been much said about the <a href=\"http://www.att.com/shop/wireless/plans/data-plans.jsp\">new AT&amp;T data plans</a>, with particular emphasis on the iPhone, as it requires a data plan.  Here are some numbers:</p>\n<pre>\n$15 / 200 MB = $0.075/MB\n$25 / 2,000 MB = $0.0125/MB\n</pre>\n<p>Then there are the overage charges.  This is silly.  If they aren&#8217;t going to offer an unlimited plan any more then just move to a standard flat rate per MB charge.  Here&#8217;s what I&#8217;d suggest:</p>\n<pre>\n$5 charge per month to enable a data plan\n$0.025 per MB in usage fees\n</pre>\n<p>On the low end, for people on the 200MB per month plan it brings the price down even further, to $10.  On the high end, 2,000MB per month, it jumps up to $55.  Use more, pay more, while making it fairly cheap to use it reasonably.</p>\n<p>And all that should include the tethering feature, no extra charge.

            "content_text": "There has been much said about the new AT&amp;T data plans, with particular emphasis on the iPhone, as it requires a data plan.  Here are some numbers:\n\n$15 / 200 MB = $0.075/MB\n$25 / 2,000 MB = $0.0125/MB\n\nThen there are the overage charges.  This is silly.  If they aren&#8217;t going to offer an unlimited plan any more then just move to a standard flat rate per MB charge.  Here&#8217;s what I&#8217;d suggest:\n\n$5 charge per month to enable a data plan\n$0.025 per MB in usage fees\n\nOn the low end, for people on the 200MB per month plan it brings the price down even further, to $10.  On the high end, 2,000MB per month, it jumps up to $55.  Use more, pay more, while making it fairly cheap to use it reasonably.\nAnd all that should include the tethering feature, no extra charge.
