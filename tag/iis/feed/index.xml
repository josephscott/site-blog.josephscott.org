					<description><![CDATA[Microsoft&#8217;s IIS.net site has a new section: PHP on IIS. This is kind of strange on several levels.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Microsoft&#8217;s <a href="http://www.iis.net/">IIS.net</a> site has a new section: <a href="http://www.iis.net/php">PHP on IIS</a>.  This is kind of strange on several levels.  First off is the idea of Microsoft supporting non-Microsoft server side languages in IIS.  Yeah, you&#8217;ve been able to do this for a long time (I remember running a perl ISAPI module in IIS in the 90s), but quite frankly it wasn&#8217;t that great.  Just getting it to run usually involved way too much voodoo.  It looks like we are starting to get something that resembles official support for PHP on IIS.</p>
<p>Another strange think is that this was announced in conjunction with their Go Live release of <a href="http://www.iis.net/downloads/default.aspx?tabid=34&amp;g=6&amp;i=1521">FastCGI for IIS 5.1 and IIS 6.0</a>.  Those using IIS 7 will have to wait until Vista SP1 or running Server 2008 Beta 3 or better.  I suppose IIS 7 doesn&#8217;t have a large share of the IIS web server market so perhaps it isn&#8217;t much of an issue.</p>
<p>It looks like FastCGI will be the official way to run PHP on IIS going forward.</p>
<p>The IIS.net site has some documentation on how to get various PHP apps running on IIS, including <a href="http://www.iis.net/articles/view.aspx/IIS7/Hosting-Web-Applications/PHP/PHP-Applications-on-IIS---WordPress">WordPress on IIS</a>.</p>
<p>My first choice is still a un*x box though <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="ðŸ™‚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I didn&#8217;t have any problems getting WordPress to work on Windows Vista, IIS7 and PHP 5 (ISAPI).  That is, until I tried to upload an image.  After hunting around and gathering tips and ideas from others here is what I had to do:</p>
<ol>
<li>Edit upload_tmp_dir option in php.ini.  In my case I created an uploads folder in the wwwroot: upload_tmp_dir = &#8220;c:inetpubwwwrootuploads&#8221;</li>
<li>Create the c:inetpubwwwrootuploads folder and grant the IUSR full control of it</li>
<li>Create the uploads folder in your wp-content folder, for me this was in c:inetpubwwwrootwordpress-trunkwp-contentsuploads, then grant the IUSR full control of it</li>
<li>Restart the IIS service (to pick up the php.ini change)</li>
</ol>
<p>After that I was able to upload files in WordPress running under Vista and IIS7.  I haven&#8217;t tried to fine tune the permissions issue, it is possible that this can be done without having to grant full control of those folders to the IUSR account.</p>
