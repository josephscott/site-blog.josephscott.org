The main push for me to do this was to try out the forums.  I&#8217;m still amazed at the number of people contacting me expressing interest in this, so I&#8217;m hoping that the forums will provide a better way for people to ask questions and get answers.

This is a rewrite based on the 0.3.3 code that uses more Prototype specific features.  If you&#8217;ve used EIP before you&#8217;ll want to review the example.html and save.php files to see how things have changed in the new version.  Nothing earth shattering, but it is different.

Here&#8217;s a list of what has changed since <a href=\"http://joseph.randomnetworks.com/archives/2006/06/07/ajax-edit-in-place-with-prototype-version-020/\">version 0.2.0</a>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The bundled version of <a href=\"http://prototype.conio.net/\">Prototype</a> is now 1.5.0_rc0.  This was mostly to make sure that my code still worked with 1.5.0_rc0.</li>\n<li>Attempt to deal with editing, updating and saving empty strings in a reasonable way</a>\n</ul>\n<p>I&#8217;ve updated the <a href=\"http://josephscott.org/code/js/eip/example.html\">example page</a> to include editing a string that starts out empty.  The example now has a link to my <a href=\"http://joseph.randomnetworks.com/tag/editinplace\">Edit In Place blog entries</a>, the <a href=\"http://josephscott.org/code/js/eip/edit.phps\">edit.php source</a> (assuming your web server knows what to do with .phps files) and the main link at the top now goes <a>http://josephscott.org/code/js/eip/</a>.</p>\n<p>Two new options have been introduced to format empty strings: empty (which is the css class to apply to empty strings, defaults to .eip_empty) and empty_text (the text to put in place of empty strings, defaults to &#8216;Click To Edit&#8217;).  These options are valid for all types (text and textarea).</p>\n<p>So go to the <a href=\"http://josephscott.org/code/js/eip/example.html\">example page</a> and click on the grey &#8216;Click To Edit&#8217; string and you&#8217;ll get an empty text box.  Type in something and you&#8217;ll get the new string instead.  Then delete the string and you&#8217;ll get the grey &#8216;Click To Edit&#8217; string again.  You can do the same thing with the original text and textarea examples.</p>\n<p>I think that I&#8217;ve covered the empty string condition, but if you find a bug please <a href=\"http://joseph.randomnetworks.com/contact/\">drop me a note</a>.  Include a patch if you are really feeling generous <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f642.png\" alt=\"\ud83d\ude42\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /></p>\n",
