										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was listening to the <a href="http://freakonomics.com/">Freakonomics podcast</a> recently and they talked about how odd it is that people can listen to it for free, yet a small portion of the listeners will still donate money.  That was their way of reminding people that they need their financial support to help pay the bills.  That is when two ideas came to mind about how Apple could provide Apple Pay options inside the Podcasts app, making it better for producers of podcasts, and the listeners.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/pay-plus-podcasts.png"><img loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/pay-plus-podcasts-1024x278.png" alt="" width="840" height="228" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-16485" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/pay-plus-podcasts-1024x278.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/03/pay-plus-podcasts-300x82.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/03/pay-plus-podcasts-768x209.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/03/pay-plus-podcasts-1200x326.png 1200w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/03/pay-plus-podcasts.png 2002w" sizes="(max-width: 840px) 100vw, 840px" /></a></p>
<p>Usually I listen to podcasts when I&#8217;m away from my laptop: in the car, out for a walk, or doing yard work.  The problem is, when I&#8217;m listening to a podcast is when I&#8217;m thinking about donating.  The gap between listening to a podcast and being at my laptop ( where it is easy to donate online ) means I forget about it more often than not.</p>
<p>For better or worse I listen to podcasts using the iOS built in Podcasts app ( which has definitely gotten worse, what is going on with this app? ).  My suggestion is that the app include an Apple Pay powered &#8220;donate&#8221; button at the podcast and episode level.  Donating via Apple Pay means that I could complete the transaction in just a few seconds, in some cases completing the donation while listening to the podcast.  That dramatically reduces the amount of friction involved in the process.</p>
<p>There are several variations on how this could work.  First up is the one time payment versus a monthly or yearly subscription.  I&#8217;d also like to have a way to do very small donations, I&#8217;m thinking less than one dollar.  Those would be used to do one time donations for my favorite episodes of a podcast, since even the best of them have some episodes that are better than others.  To lessen the impact of these smaller transactions I&#8217;d setup a monthly tip jar budget.  Apple Pay charges me $10 per month and then lets me apply that later for my per episode small donations.</p>
<p>The next level in this process is making it possible for podcast publishers to include pre-roll and post-roll content based on if the person has donated or not.  The worst part of every NPR pledge drive is that even if you give them money, you still have to listen to the &#8220;please support us&#8221; messages for the rest of the week.  With the Podcasts app Apple can make that problem go away.  For those that have donated, instead of a five minute ask at the beginning of a podcast episode, publishers could include a 10 second thank you message for supporting them.</p>
<p>This makes the Podcasts app similar to the App Store that we know today.  That comparison brings up the issue of the revenue split between Apple and the podcast publisher.  Using the high end App Store split of 85 / 15 would be a good starting point.  I&#8217;d like to see Apple be more aggressive with that split, giving even more to the podcast publishers.</p>
<p>Also like the App Store, this is another way to rank podcasts.  You could drill down even further, ranking individual episodes.</p>
<p>What do you say Apple, can this make it into iOS 12 please?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Alex Blumberg has a new podcast &#8211; <a href="http://hearstartup.com/">StartUp</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
I&#8217;m Alex Blumberg. My experience is in public radio, as a producer for This American Life and as a co-founder of the business-economics series Planet Money. After years of reporting on other people&#8217;s businesses, I decided to start my own.</p>
<p>This show follows what happens next – my difficult journey from man to businessman. It&#8217;s a classic start-up story, but one that&#8217;s recorded in real time. I&#8217;ve documented disastrous pitches to investors, difficult conversations with my wife, and tense negotiations with my co-founder. The result is an honest, transparent account of something that happens all the time, but that we can rarely listen in on: starting a business.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I found all four of the episodes posted so far really enjoyable.  Part of that comes from having listened to Alex Blumberg before and the good production quality.  </p>
<p>The other part is the feeling that you are along for the ride, sitting in the back seat of a car while two people are talking about this experience.</p>
