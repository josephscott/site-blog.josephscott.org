										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday <a href='http://www.engadget.com/2012/04/24/skype-launches-on-ps-vita/'>Skype launched for the PS Vita</a>, which is pretty cool.  It is just seven years late is all.</p>
<p>After using a Sony PSP back in April 2005 I wrote <a href="http://joseph.randomnetworks.com/2005/04/05/sony-psp-can-it-do-voip/">Sony PSP, Can It Do VOIP?</a>.  I specifically suggested Skype support:</p>
<blockquote><p>
So VOIP on a PSP. Hmmmm, what would sort of software would you actually use to do such a thing? Then another idea came to mind, Skype. If you could port Skype to the PSP then you’d not only be able to VOIP with your PSP, you’d get all of the other things Skype can do. VOIP to VOIP calls, VOIP to POTS calls, conference calls, file transfers and chat. You’d be limited to where you could get WiFi access, but it’s a start.
</p></blockquote>
<p>With Skype now <strike>pwned</strike> owned by Microsoft, this seems like a strange time to make this move.  I would have expected Microsoft push for Skype support on the Xbox to happen before a competing platform.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Most of have come to terms with the idea that some software come with rather evil components that try to take over Windows systems, or attack others, etc.  Usually the software packages that do this are on shaky ground to start with, are fairly easy to avoid.  I guess <a href="http://www.sony.com/">Sony</a> was looking to change all that.</p>
<p>Before you go out and buy another CD read through &#8220;<a href="http://www.sysinternals.com/blog/2005/10/sony-rootkits-and-digital-rights.html">Sony, Rootkits and Digital Rights Management Gone Too Far</a>&#8220;.  It seems that the CD &#8220;Get Right with the Man&#8221; by Van Zant will install a poorly written rootkit on your Windows system.  This is bad news, it is becoming increasingly difficult to know who to trust in these matters.  Before it was a pretty good rule of thumb that if you only installed software from reputable vendors then you&#8217;d be okay.  The list of vendors considered reputable seems to be decreasing rapidly.</p>
