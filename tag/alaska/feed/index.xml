<p>For the 4th of July Sarah bought the girls this t-shirt.  The design is simple enough, it&#8217;s the U.S. flag contoured to the shape of the United States.  Below that is the text &#8216;Faded Glory 2009&#8217;.  There&#8217;s nothing else on the shirt.</p>
<p>The girls loved wearing matching shirts and Sarah and I both wore red shirts for the 4th as well to help blend in.  Okay mine was a red WordPress shirt, but it&#8217;s the thought that counts <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="ðŸ™‚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>Every time I looked at those shirts though it seemed like something wasn&#8217;t quite right.  It wasn&#8217;t until we were out shopping and we saw them again that it finally dawned on me.  There&#8217;s no Alaska or Hawaii.  The flag image only uses the continental 48 states.  I wonder if they tried to sell these shirts in Alaska or Hawaii, and if so did anyone there actually buy one?</p>
<p>What I really wanted to do was take a black marker and cross out the 2009 in the text below the flag image and write in 1958.  That was the last year that the United States only had 48 states (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._states_by_date_of_statehood">list of U.S. states</a>).</p>
