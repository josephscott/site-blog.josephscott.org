										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tesla has built a new store location in Utah ( I drove past it last week, strange spot, but near the freeway, so good for charging ), but as Beehive Startups ( and many others ) notes <a href="http://beehivestartups.com/blog/why-tesla-not-allowed-utah-um-were-not-really-sure/">Tesla is not allowed to sell cars in Utah</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
now we sit at an awkward impasse. Tesla is left scratching their heads, sitting on a dealership they can’t legally open, and Utah is left in the contradictory position of claiming to be a state supporting innovation and new business while doing the exact opposite. Anyone wanting to purchase a Tesla must do so outside the state.
</p></blockquote>
<p>A bill was presented, <a href="http://le.utah.gov/~2015/bills/hbillint/HB0394S02.pdf">H.B. 394</a>, that would have made it possible for Tesla to sell vehicles in Utah.  Unfortunately it was defeated: 41 no, 32 yes.  I&#8217;ve already contacted my rep asking for an explanation on why he voted against it.  I haven&#8217;t received a response yet.</p>
<p>Let me be clear, I won&#8217;t be buying a Tesla vehicle, they are way out of my price range.  My complaint is over how disappointed I am in seeing the legal system being used to block what seems to be a reasonable request: allow a car company to sell cars.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The New Jersey response to Tesla wanting to sell direct:</p>
<blockquote><p>
&#8220;This Musk guy, he wants all the profits for himself,&#8221; says Tom Dougherty, a 25-year veteran of the business who now works in sales at the BMW dealership in upscale Princeton, New Jersey. &#8220;They wanted to go direct, which means no sales force. That’s cutting out a lot of people. No way that’s gonna fly.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>via <a href='http://www.theverge.com/2014/3/19/5525544/new-jersey-auto-dealers-respond-to-teslas-elon-musk' title="Should have gone with a Star Wars 'strike back' reference.">The Verge, Auto dealers fire back</a>.</p>
<p>I disagree that &#8220;go direct&#8221; means &#8220;no sales force&#8221;, but it no doubt means a smaller sales force, definitely with fewer people in the middle.  In general this whole quote does nothing to make people want to feel sympathetic towards car dealerships.</p>
