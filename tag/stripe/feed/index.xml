										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the things really interesting services trigger is other interesting services built on top of it.  It was that thinking that had me looking at <a href='https://baremetrics.com/'>Baremetrics</a>, &#8220;Analytics &amp; Insights for Stripe&#8221;.  This is the type of data everyone who deals with money wants to see.</p>
<p>Beyond that they offer something that is definitely outside the box: public revenue dashboards.  In the past I&#8217;ve come across dashboards for <a href="https://buffer.baremetrics.com/dashboard">Buffer</a> and <a href="https://ghost.baremetrics.com/dashboard">Ghost</a>.  <a href="https://baremetrics.com/open">baremetrics.com/open</a> has a list of sites with public dashboards, including <a href="https://demo.baremetrics.com/">Baremetrics</a> itself.  Not every company wants to be so transparent with money matters, for those that do Baremetrics has made it very easy.</p>
<p>I wonder how Stripe thinks about Baremetrics.  There is the traditional corporate method: Stripe should acquire them and offer the analytics as an add on themselves.  Then others put forward the idea that having a thriving third party ecosystem is more important for the long term health and survival of Stripe.</p>
<p>Which approach would you take?</p>
