										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://adactio.com/">Jeremy Keith</a> suggests <a href="https://adactio.com/journal/16295">two changes to the browser default behavior</a>.</p>
<h3>HTTPS First</h3>
<p>When you type in <code>example.com</code> with no protocol, the browser tries HTTP first.  His suggestion is to change that to HTTPS instead.  Then if HTTPS fails, fall back to HTTP.</p>
<p>This falls under the &#8220;trying to be correct by default&#8221; behavior.  Our browsers should generally encrypt traffic to sites by default.  If you type in <code><strong>http</strong>://example.com</code>, then you are directing it to make a request that is plain text, and it should follow that direction.  Outside of that, better to do encryption by default.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m in favor of this kind of change.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d even consider going one step further: flip <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Strict-Transport-Security">HSTS ( HTTP Strict-Transport-Security )</a>.  Instead of requiring sites to opt-in to telling browsers that a site should be HTTPS only, default to HTTPS and require the site to opt-in to a plain HTTP version.  That is a bigger change, that will require more work &#8211; namely that we need more <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">Let&#8217;s Encrypt</a> alternatives &#8211; but I think we can get there.</p>
<h3>Assume Viewport</h3>
<p>The question:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Responsive design has swept the web. What would happen if mobile browsers were to assume <code>width=device-width</code>?
</p></blockquote>
<p>The big push for this came from mobile, Safari specifically.  That ship has sailed, no point in trying to pretend that we will ever go back. I&#8217;m in favor of this kind of change.</p>
<h3>Improving Defaults</h3>
<p>As technology changes, it is healthy to re-evaluate our defaults.  Most people won&#8217;t change them, so a &#8220;protect the user&#8221; attitude should weigh heavily in how defaults are managed over time.</p>
