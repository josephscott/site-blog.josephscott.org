										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It is no secret that <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/">Dropbox</a> has been expanding their services well beyond just &#8220;syncing files&#8221;.  For the most part I have ignored those additional features, nailing the job of syncing files was valuable enough for me.</p>
<p>Recently though, they have been updating the MacOS client to do more.  And again, I&#8217;ve generally ignored that, I&#8217;m really only interested in using Dropbox to sync files.  I find that so valuable that I&#8217;ve been a paying customer for a number of years.</p>
<p>There are parts of the MacOS client update that I can&#8217;t ignore, namely the amount of the memory it now consumes:</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/dropbox.png"><img loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/dropbox.png" alt="" width="785" height="356" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-17841" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/dropbox.png 785w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/11/dropbox-300x136.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/11/dropbox-768x348.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 785px) 100vw, 785px" /></a></p>
<p>To be very clear, this is on MacOS 10.14.6 and Dropbox 86.3.141.  That combination ends up going through more than 650 MB of memory.  All I want to do is reliably sync files, and that feels like too much memory for that one job.</p>
<p>As a comparison, I tried out <a href="https://www.synology.com/en-us/dsm/feature/drive">Synology Drive</a>, which has a MacOS client for syncing files with a Synology NAS.  I was surprised at the difference in memory usage:</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/synology-drive.png"><img loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/synology-drive.png" alt="" width="759" height="210" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-17847" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/synology-drive.png 759w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/11/synology-drive-300x83.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 759px) 100vw, 759px" /></a></p>
<p>With Synology Drive Client 2.0.1-11061 there is less than 100 MB of memory used.</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t a perfect comparison, I&#8217;d categorize Synology Drive as more basic than Dropbox, but broadly speaking for me they have the same purpose: sync files.  I don&#8217;t see where that warrants a difference in memory usage of more than 500 MB.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dropbox <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/developers/blog/90/announcing-dropbox-webhooks">launched support for webhooks</a>.  This is a great move.</p>
<p>Amazon S3 does have something similar.  You can enable <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/NotificationHowTo.html">notifications via their Simple Notification Service ( SNS )</a>, but then you are charged for the SNS usage.  For many people that will make it less appealing than traditional direct webhooks.</p>
<p>Dropbox continues to use a mix of Amazon Web Services ( AWS ) and separate dedicated hardware to manage user file.  I wonder if they are using any AWS services to process what are likely millions of HTTP requests for webhooks.</p>
