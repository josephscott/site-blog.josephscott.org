I don&#8217;t know the details of what other costs Jason has to pay for to keep the new <a href=\"http://www.netscape.com/\">Netscape.com</a> up, but one thing seems clear, he won&#8217;t be loosing money by paying people for story links.</p>\n<p>Now for the other end of these numbers, what the &#8220;<a href=\"http://www.calacanis.com/2006/07/18/everyones-gotta-eat-or-1-000-a-month-for-doing-what-youre/\">Netscape Navigators</a>&#8221; get out of this.  To make things easier we&#8217;ll assume that they will be working regular business days, 23 per month.  To meet the 150 links per month they will have to submit about 7 per day.  Using the 2-3 hours per day that Jason mentioned each link is allotted 17 to 25 minutes.  Not a completely unreasonable time frame I think.
