					<description><![CDATA[My hope would be that most people would move to full feeds once AdSense for feeds is widely available.  I don&#039;t know if that will happen, but that would be my hope.  I generally prefer full feeds over excerpts.

There will undoubtedly still be people who insist of excerpt feeds and will still put ads in them.  These will likely be the same folks whose sites are already plastered with ads.

I&#039;m not sure where this will settle, but I think given time a happy medium will be found for most feeds between content and ads.  That is a question that we still have to wait on until we get and answer.  The question this week has already answered is that ads for feeds are here today and they are likely going to take over just the way AdSense did for website ads.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Do you mean full-text feeds?  Or do you think all feeds, even excerpt-only feeds, will have ads?

Seems to me that excerpt-only feeds are already advertisements, advertisements for the full content on the website.  Putting ads in those feeds may undercut the goal of driving traffic to the website.]]></description>
