I generally prefer full feeds over excerpts.\n\nThere will undoubtedly still be people who insist of excerpt feeds and will still put ads in them.  These will likely be the same folks whose sites are already plastered with ads.\n\nI'm not sure where this will settle, but I think given time a happy medium will be found for most feeds between content and ads.  That is a question that we still have to wait on until we get and answer.  The question this week has already answered is that ads for feeds are here today and they are likely going to take over just the way AdSense did for website ads.",
