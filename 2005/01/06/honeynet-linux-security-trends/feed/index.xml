					<description><![CDATA[I agree. Also, the metrics to not actually reveal how long the &quot;linux&quot; machines take to compromise (how frequently they were attacked, how long the successful attacks took, etc.). You can sit one vulnerable Fedora box on the net, and observe that it took 3 months before it was compromised. Was your box even noticed before that? It could have been discovered and attacked 2 months and 3 weeks into the run.

Just my 2 cents.]]></description>
