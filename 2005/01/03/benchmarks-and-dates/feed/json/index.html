The reasons the benchmarks dont matter, (not to mention date...).\n\nSQLite is not client/server based, therfore the entire inner workings of the product is different compared to the others.  If you want to get down to the nitty gritty to compare them at all is pointless.  For Example : Where's the benchmark for metwork latency?  Since SQLite has no network latency you are going to see a significant speed increase.  Also the fact that SQLite runs in a single process and the others need a minimum of 2 processes running there is going to be another hit.\n\nThe benchmark is there for people who dont know much about databases.  Like a technical manager or something like that ;).  So when hes surfing the net looking to save money, and says \"Why dont we use that?!?!\"  blah blah blah...  We're still on MySQL.\n\nI guess what I'm trying to say in a nutshell, is that comparing SQLite to MySQL is like comparing and XML database API to MySQL.  SQLite is getting better but is still not a databse yet.\nie..\nNo column type contraints.\nText can be put in an int column.\nThey are just now getting around to adding ALTER TABLE statements that allow you to adjust columns.\n\nDon't get me wrong I think its a slick package, and with time may mature very well.\n\nI'm just rambling...  but that benchmark in the first place is a joke.",
