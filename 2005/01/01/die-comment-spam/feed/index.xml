					<description><![CDATA[Well exelent choise with will bring the peace back in your comments and in your mailbox.
Had 2 logs, 1 with this hack and 1 without. The one without had a number of plugins and hacks , and had renamed comment files. Still they manage to deliver me around 5 a 9 hunderd spams a day. Yesterday they managed to actualy bypass all the spamblock things and posted around 400 comments. That was the end for me, now al my wordpress logs have this hack.
