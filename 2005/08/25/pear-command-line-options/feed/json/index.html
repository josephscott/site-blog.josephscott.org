Thanks for the hint -- it is installed in where I installed PEAR when doing a local installation of PEAR.\n\nI copy the pear.conf and renamed it as pear.ini and put it under C:Windows (default path for PEAR index.php to start the webbased PEAR package manager on my local server). Using this webbased PEAR package manager is a lot more convenient to manage PEAR.\n\nThanks again!\n\nKYC",
