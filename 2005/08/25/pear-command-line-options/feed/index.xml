					<description><![CDATA[Hi Joseph,

Your post help me to understand where is the pear.conf. It is so obvious, but I spent days googling. Thanks for the hint -- it is installed in where I installed PEAR when doing a local installation of PEAR.

I copy the pear.conf and renamed it as pear.ini and put it under C:Windows (default path for PEAR index.php to start the webbased PEAR package manager on my local server). Using this webbased PEAR package manager is a lot more convenient to manage PEAR.

Thanks again!
