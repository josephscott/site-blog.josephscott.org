If you ever stop by and give it a try, any feedback would be greatly appreciated. :)

Thanks!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi, I found your blog post through a search for &quot;Nertz&quot;. It is cool to see others that know about the game. I hope you don&#039;t mind but I wanted to let you know about playnertz.com, the site for the National Nertz Association. There is a bunch of interesting Nertz information there and you can also find out how to play Nertz online there. I hope you will check it out. Feel free to join and also let your friends and family know. Thanks again]]></description>
