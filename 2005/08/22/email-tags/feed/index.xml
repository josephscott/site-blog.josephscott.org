Well, at least there are a few options out there now.  I&#039;m not sure that they work very well with each other though.  There really needs to be a simple email tags spec so that things work as expected.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Taglocity (www.taglocity.com) has a free/commercial Outlook Add-In for tagging. It has some really nice features such as a tag cloud, Bayesian learning for auto-tagging, tag renaming, etc.

I have been testing interoperability between TB&#039;s tagging feature and the Taglocity plugin, and found a somewhat annoying compatibility issue:

TB stores its tags in the &quot;Tags&quot; element of the header, while
Taglocity uses the &quot;Keywords&quot; element! Meaning, of course, that tags aren&#039;t cross-recognized on the two platforms.

Anyone know a fix for this?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This sounds like a great idea.
I would love to have this as a plugin feature on outlook./
Hey maybe you can even go open source with it and so something for Thunderbird just to get the idea popular.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Mark&#039;s idea of using Categories (from the preview pane, highlight the email or emails you want to tag and choose Edit-Categories and assign the Category).  You can then sort or search for the messages by Category.  I had no idea to try this, but Mark is my hero!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Wow, this is so awesome!  I am a soon to be graduate in Information Technology and I have been tossing this email and file tagging/labeling/keywording idea around since I started designing databases in Access almost ten years ago.  Databases make indexing and searching a natural way of life to support views and queries, and I thought to myself, &quot;Well, why don&#039;t they make that for files and emails?&quot;  Just keep them all in one place (like a table, not in silly folders) and have searches (views or queries) to filter out the files/emails you need with whatever subject or keywords at any given point in time.  Then you don&#039;t have to worry where you&#039;re filing crap - or file it at all!  My over 10,000 emails at home could use such a system.

I was so happy when I found out GMail and Vista support it.  Filing in file folders is thinking in PHYSICAL concepts!  It&#039;s about time we thought electronically!

So there&#039;s my two cents.  Sorry I can&#039;t contribute to your project personally, but I thank everyone involved...if it&#039;s still going on...]]></description>
