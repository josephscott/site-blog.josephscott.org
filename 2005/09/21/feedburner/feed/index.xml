I&#039;ve gotten a bit wishy washy on the whole FeedBurner thing.  If you subscribe to it you should still be getting updates, but I&#039;m not as keen on linking to it as I used to be.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Joseph,

I&#039;m not getting your posts through Bloglines anymore - did you consolidate all your feeds to Feedburner?  I&#039;ve had trouble with Feedburner and Bloglines in the past on my own blog.  I went to the Feedburner forums and they tested my feeds across all the readers.  Turned out it was just a problem with Bloglines.  I emailed them with the feed url and the feeds started flowing again after that.]]></description>
