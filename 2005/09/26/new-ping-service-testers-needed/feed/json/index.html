It seems to me that we&#8217;d do well to look at some other services for ideas and inspiration. The first one that comes to my mind is DNS. No ads on DNS, and not many fees are being charged for it. Perhaps we should come up with some sort of distributed model for handling blog pings? If we have a distributed service, no single server would have to bear the entire load, and we can probably avoid the traffic cost and scaling issues. But now about point #5 &#8212; Obviously pings need to be acknowledged very quickly, but do pings need to be delivered fast? Joseph&#8217;s ping service is based on a queueing model, which seems reasonable and more practical to me.

We're also working closely with upstream providers to stop spam, unfortunately many of the new services cropping up are just functioning as open relays for ping junk. Ping-O-Matic is also going to be much faster once we bring the partner mirrors online.",
