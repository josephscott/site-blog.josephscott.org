If you were to store it as characters, it would take up 37 bytes, but the binary representation is more compact and takes up 16 bytes. The reason UUID's are so unique is that there is a 1:3.40282367 \u00d7 10^(38) chance of getting of the same UUID if you have a perfectly random random number generator, which you don't but even 1% of those odds means you'll never see the same UUID twice, or so they say. Since a lot of websites use UUID's for pages I tried googling 500K UUIDS in my database and none matched. \nI am using UUID's for my db application because I need uniqueness amongst several independent machines. There is no way to do this without a central server model, so I'm using UUIDs for primary keys. Obviously there is no way to ask for next record or previous record but I don't need that functionality.",
