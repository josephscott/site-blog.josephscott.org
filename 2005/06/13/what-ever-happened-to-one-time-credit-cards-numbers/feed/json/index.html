Of couse, it was an unauthorized transaction that took me MONTHS to get straight, although I called and emailed them several times within an hour of the original transaction fraud.\n\nI think there are problems with it being secure.  I definitely feel it's harder for them to control hacks or what have you than if you have to use a real card, so I figure that's why so many of these one time use cards have disappeared.  You get them because you want it to be more secure, just to find out that it is actually much less secure.",
