					<description><![CDATA[I used the PayPal Virtual Card when it was launched and had my only problem in over 10+ using PayPal.  Of couse, it was an unauthorized transaction that took me MONTHS to get straight, although I called and emailed them several times within an hour of the original transaction fraud.

I think there are problems with it being secure.  I definitely feel it&#039;s harder for them to control hacks or what have you than if you have to use a real card, so I figure that&#039;s why so many of these one time use cards have disappeared.  You get them because you want it to be more secure, just to find out that it is actually much less secure.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Yeah on the security,
I just receive a snail mail telling me that the company had a security breach, somebody had breached/hacked into the data bases and my credit card info was one of the ones that got snatched.

It was a few days before I was notified, but as soon as I found out, I cancelled and had them re-issue me a new CC.

					<description><![CDATA[Security is the big problem the credit card companies are grappling with. There is such a huge amount of their yearly budgets fighting credit card fraud, lost and stolen credit cards, and of course identity theft.

Trying to find money, time, and resources to completely overhaul their technologies is a real challenge going forward. (I know....I used to work for Amex)
