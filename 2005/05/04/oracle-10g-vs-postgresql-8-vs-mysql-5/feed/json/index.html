I liked the first article because you picked a very specific part of the software and explained what you were looking for and how you were going to score it.  This second article isn't as precise in the this same way.  I think your conclusion is correct, but I'd like to see less of the general discussion and more of the specifics because I think that helps people understand the issues in greater detail.\n\nTeo-\n\nI'm not sure what why you indicate that PostgreSQL has limitations with multiple CPUs.  Each job forks another process that can be run on a different CPU.  That is really a job for the OS though, not the database software.  I believe that at least one of the replication solutions involved triggers, so again I'm not sure why you indicate that as limitation/issue.  I'm not familiar with the needs of Chinese arithmetic so I can't speak as to how well that is or isn't supported.  Getting the hardware to scale is mostly a job of the OS.",

I think I mention it somewhere in the article that the version of MySQL was a beta and that I was giving them a little \"benefit\" because of that.

I listed Oracle, MYSQL, PostgreSQL, Firebird and xBase.  I didn't get many responses at all and none for postgreSQL, but I will be writing a comparison of utilities available out of the box in an upcoming article.  Again, I'll compare Oracle, MYSQL and PostgreSQL.\n\nAgain, this will be on low end hardware (although a little higher end than the last one, PIII 1GHz with 512MB) and more for a user or business type rather than a programmer type.\n\nThe emails I've gotten have mostly been asking me to cover more advanced Oracle topics.\n\nThanks again for the good words,\n\nLewis R Cunningham\nhttp://www.suite101.com/welcome.cfm/oracle\nhttp://blogs.ittoolbox.com/oracle/guide/",
