					<description><![CDATA[Yeah, I get the feeling teo just heard a rummor about the patch and exaggerated it to the point of creating some fud -- there really aren&#039;t that many 16+CPU systems out there today -- and even if they were, the patch has been posted and anyone with such a system can afford the resources to maintain that patch themselves until it&#039;s in the mainstream release.

I am curious what he meant by chinese math being different too.

I just though I&#039;d answer constructively though :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Here is a direct link to the discussion, along with benchmark results.

http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-general/2005-03/msg00837.php

On a 16 CPU Altix with 192GB of memory, the previous release 8.0.X wouls start decresing in performance with 32 or 64 clients making simultaneous requests.  With the improved SMP support (2005-03-16 and later) we no longer see the performance falloff and with 32 simultanous clients the new version is about twice as fast as 8.0.X

On small SMP systems (a quad-CPU Itanium and a quad-CPU AMD64 were also benchmarked) the changes were less dramatic.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Joseph:  &quot;Iâ€™m not sure what why you indicate that PostgreSQL has limitations with multiple CPUs. Each job forks another process that can be run on a different CPU. That is really a job for the OS though, not the database software&quot;.

The issue was one with the time that certain locks within the database were held for certain specific operations.  If you have a large SMP machine (dozens of CPUs) see some checkins to the 8.1 branch from Tom L and read the discussions on the mailinglist to see if these apply to you.

Note that postgresql already uses less locking - especially less exclusive locking - than other databases; so while it&#039;s true this is a &quot;limitation with multiple CPUs&quot; when compared about theoretical limits postgresql is already ahead compared to other databases,]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Lewis-

Thanks for the heads up.  I liked the first article because you picked a very specific part of the software and explained what you were looking for and how you were going to score it.  This second article isn&#039;t as precise in the this same way.  I think your conclusion is correct, but I&#039;d like to see less of the general discussion and more of the specifics because I think that helps people understand the issues in greater detail.

Teo-

I&#039;m not sure what why you indicate that PostgreSQL has limitations with multiple CPUs.  Each job forks another process that can be run on a different CPU.  That is really a job for the OS though, not the database software.  I believe that at least one of the replication solutions involved triggers, so again I&#039;m not sure why you indicate that as limitation/issue.  I&#039;m not familiar with the needs of Chinese arithmetic so I can&#039;t speak as to how well that is or isn&#039;t supported.  Getting the hardware to scale is mostly a job of the OS.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi,

Lewis Cunningham again.  Just wanted you to know I published an opinion piece on the open source competition that Oracle faces from MySQL and PostgreSQL.

I also talk a little about Netezza which uses PostgreSQL.

It&#039;s on my ITToolbox blog, http://blogs.ittoolbox.com/oracle/guide/archives/004312.asp

Actually in the last week or so I wrote a couple of blogs about Oracle and open source.  Some people believe Oracle can go open source.  I don&#039;t think so.

Anyway, just wanted to let you know.  If you think anyone else would be interested, please let them know also.

Thanks,

Lewis C

					<description><![CDATA[Joesph,

Thanks for reviewing my article.  I enjoyed writing it and plan to work more with PostgreSQL in my freetime.  I&#039;m not a convert yet but time will tell.  ;-)

Just a note on why I ranked them the way I did on documentation.  I think I mention it somewhere in the article that the version of MySQL was a beta and that I was giving them a little &quot;benefit&quot; because of that.  PostgreSQL 8.0 was production and like you said, the lack of documentation was about the same.  It was a judgement call on my part and I know not everyone agrees but it was an honest call on my part.

I ran a poll on my suite101 site asking which databases I should cover.  I listed Oracle, MYSQL, PostgreSQL, Firebird and xBase.  I didn&#039;t get many responses at all and none for postgreSQL, but I will be writing a comparison of utilities available out of the box in an upcoming article.  Again, I&#039;ll compare Oracle, MYSQL and PostgreSQL.

Again, this will be on low end hardware (although a little higher end than the last one, PIII 1GHz with 512MB) and more for a user or business type rather than a programmer type.

The emails I&#039;ve gotten have mostly been asking me to cover more advanced Oracle topics.

Thanks again for the good words,

Lewis R Cunningham

					<description><![CDATA[I believe that any DataLayer must be a simple code block, that they allow operations against DB.

That code block would not have to know on the Business Entities. Single to specialize it is to execute the operations (Store Procedures and SQL Sentences) against the engine DB (SQL, Oracle, DB2, etc.), with which this setting.

Finally, I invite to you to download the DataLayer.Primitives Public Version.

This is very cool Data Layer :)

DataLayer.Primitives - Readme!
