I think that even though some might feel that the show's end result might be overly lavish for a single family, I guess I would rather have the show in existence rather than not  - that way, at least good people who are in genuine need after enduring extraordinary hardships (in most cases) have the opportunity to see life as \"good\" once again. Life is hard for most all of us, but then having to deal with some of the terrible things these families have gone through is something I don't even want to imagine having to endure.\n\nGiven all that, I would like to alert as many good-hearted people as possible to an effort that is underway to change another family's life through Extreme Makeover: Home Edition. I'm not someone who typically gets involved in an effort like this simply because we are accustomed to seeing so many scams online or in our email. So I'm a little bit astonished that I am here trying to reach out on someone's else's behalf. The difference is, that I have taken the time to learn about this family, and I can say with 100% confidence that this case is purely a heartfelt effort by a bunch of people whose hearts have been touched by this family's story. I haven't seen every single episode of EMHE, but of those I have seen, this family's experience goes well beyond the awful hardships the show has already brought to our attention.\n\nAnyway, please take a look at the website located at http://www.homeforlila.com. Take the time, if you can spare a few minutes to really read about this woman and her family. And then, if you feel so inclined, there's a link that leads to where you can leave a nomination, and as individuals who have found our own reasons for why we believe in the spirit of the show's intent, please identify yourself as such because your voice counts...it absolutely counts.",

Those families all work with someone from ABC to figure out what things need to stay in the house, etc. There is prep work done ahead of time, but apparently the family doesn't know until the design team shows up at their door that they actually won.\n\nABC undoubtably knows early enough to order the stuff or find a builder, which sounded like it was a selection process as well.\n\nEveryone is tightlipped about when the show will air. So I am guessing there is a definate lag in actually building/taping, editing and ready for TV.\n\nAs for a more effective way to spend money, I am hoping communities use this as a jumping off point. Sometimes seeing that it can be done and how it can be done, might mean it can be done more often and by more people.  The \"extreme\" part of this might be helpful in that way.
