No problem, it bugged me for awhile as well, which is why I wrote this up in the first place.

As for trash, I think by default it uses a folder named Trash.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[[...] I also have mail disappearing from my inbox. It is still saved on the server, as I can see it on OWA, but my inbox is completely empty on mail.app. Anyone?? [...]

I came across the same problem; after years of problem-free use the file system of my server that runs Courier IMAP filled up.  After cleaning up the partition and restarting imapd, the messages in my Inbox don&#039;t show anymore.  However, all subfolders of the Inbox DO show up and are updated.  Strangely enough, even the unread count is being updated in the Inbox -- but neither old nor new messages appear in the message list.

I&#039;ve tried to completely remove the IMAP account from the Mail.app prefs as well as wiped out ~/Library/Mail/IMAP-my-account to no avail; hence I suspect that the problem might be on the server side.  But then Thunderbird shows all the messages in the same Inbox correctly... I&#039;m puzzled.

Did you by any chance solve this mystery?

Thanks for any hint,

Peter]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Kelly:

I picked up this hint from a PDF I found while looking for how to set up delegates, this is probably what you are looking for: TO disable public folder syncing:
1. quit mail.app
2. go to your Library/Mail/ folder, look in the exchange box there, and find the Public Folders folder.
3. Do get info (cmd-i)
4. set permissions to &quot;No access&quot;.
5. next time you start up mail, you&#039;ll see the public folders still, but they won&#039;t have any content, and won&#039;t sync.

Now...

If anyone knows how to read a delegate account in Mail, or how to set up 2 exchange accounts (I can create one, but after that, only choic e is IMAP or POP), or how to get the stupid calendar link to actually point to our web exchange server that I specified in the prefs, instead of to the incoming exchange server, I&#039;d be a happy man.

					<description><![CDATA[I have connected mail to our MS Exchange 2003 server. When setting up the account, I chose &quot;Exchange&quot; as the option and made sure it kept NTLM authentication. Strange part, though, is that it used just may username not domain/username which I was not used to. For OWA, it may require HTTPS (ours did).

That said, if anyone knows how I can disable the @#$@# public folders from showing up / being sync&#039;d, it&#039;d be great. It&#039;s such a pain to watch it sync some 100k emails in there when I have no desire to read &#039;em.
