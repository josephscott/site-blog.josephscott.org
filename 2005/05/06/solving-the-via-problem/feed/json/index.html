Maybe, for a post that has a single \"hat-tip\", we could use the same idea with replacing <code>name=\"in-reply-to\"</code> with <code>name=\"hat-tip\"</code> or <code>name=\"link-via\"</code>.",

Personally, I'd rather get a basic microformat first, then look into something like that later. Of course, I may be the only one.\n\nSecond, I can't find any references to using the refid attribute in the cite tag. Are you sure this is valid XHTML? If so, I'd appreciate a pointer to some info on it. Same thing goes for the type attribute.\n\nI'd like to provide a way for people to encode this information, but it may be more productive to figure out the basic problem first.\n\nAnd, as a sidenote, I prefer the name citeVia to hVia, so it may change.
