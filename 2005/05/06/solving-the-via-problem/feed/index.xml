					<description><![CDATA[Not quite sure if this might help, but a while ago I came up with the idea of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ramikayyali.com/archives/2005/01/13/discussions&quot; title=&quot;Blog Discussions&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;using a meta tag&lt;/a&gt; to indicate that a certain post is a reply. Maybe, for a post that has a single &quot;hat-tip&quot;, we could use the same idea with replacing &lt;code&gt;name=&quot;in-reply-to&quot;&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code&gt;name=&quot;hat-tip&quot;&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;name=&quot;link-via&quot;&lt;/code&gt;.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[First of all, I absolutely want something that will work with the current spec. People are already using via-links, there&#039;s no reason to make people wait for a new version of xhtml or use a namespace to make it work better.

Of course, the q tag is for a direct quotation. I think via links are similar, yet different. We&#039;re giving attribution (which is a citation), but not for the content itself. Instead, the attribution is for a pointer to the content.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[If you are looking for something to work with in the current spec then we&#039;ll probably have to think about this in a different way.  I wasn&#039;t overly concerned with following current attributes while throwing out my first few ideas.  Not worrying about encoding how we discovered the link certainly reduces the problem set.

Using the id attribute becomes a problem because it needs to be unique also, which I&#039;d thought of that before :-(

There are also no specific attributes for the cite tag, so we&#039;d have to use one of the general element attributes.

Now that I&#039;m looking through the HTML spec, it looks like the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/struct/text.html#edef-Q&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;q tag&lt;/a&gt; might be a good place to start.  Using the cite element of the q tag does a good job of providing the information in a parser friendly way, but it doesn&#039;t display very well to a human reader.

Plenty more to think about.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Joseph- thanks for the feedback, I have a couple of responses‚Äì

We think that at this time trying to encode the vector type is too much. Personally, I&#039;d rather get a basic microformat first, then look into something like that later. Of course, I may be the only one.

Second, I can&#039;t find any references to using the refid attribute in the cite tag. Are you sure this is valid XHTML? If so, I&#039;d appreciate a pointer to some info on it. Same thing goes for the type attribute.

I&#039;d like to provide a way for people to encode this information, but it may be more productive to figure out the basic problem first.

And, as a sidenote, I prefer the name citeVia to hVia, so it may change. Anyway, thanks for the discussion, please continue with feedback.]]></description>
