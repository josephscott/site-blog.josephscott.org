					<description><![CDATA[&quot;....Apache does not pass the HTTP basic headers to CGI applications, so they never see them...&quot;

So how do we work around this, for those of us who don&#039;t have access to an IIS server?

I can&#039;t get it figured out on my WP blog, and we i=even use WP as a CMS for iother types of web sites.

Can you please give me more inof on this matter? Thanks! I really appreciate it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Someone wrote that the RewriteRule method of passing the Http Basic authorization string to the CGI application is &quot;abusing&quot; mod_rewrite.  I disagree.  Just glance at the mod_rewrite docs -- it was obviously meant for much more than just URL aliasing, and method described above is a trivial usage of the module. Don&#039;t expect Apache to change its CGI security behavior to make the password available by default, because such a change is likely to make many existing scripts less secure and that would be irresponsible.  A line or two of configuration for those who need it is not so bad in comparison.]]></description>
