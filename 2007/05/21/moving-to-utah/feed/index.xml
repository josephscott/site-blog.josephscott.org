					<description><![CDATA[We used BlueRoof to find our home and we have been so impressed with them. We would recommend them to anyone. We didn&#039;t work with Greg directly but he was really helpful and answered our calls late on a Sunday night (when we planned on leaving a message) and spent a good ten minutes just explaining some things for us.

We really liked the other people we worked with that they referred us to also. I just want to share our experience.]]></description>
