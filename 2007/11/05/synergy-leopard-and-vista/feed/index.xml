					<description><![CDATA[I am wondering if it is a change in 10.5.6 because I just got a new mini and have the same problem. I can host from the mini with an error, but I cannot get any connection hosting from my vista?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi alll,
I have  MacBook Leopard 10.5.6 running SynergyKM as a Host and a Win Xp sp3 as a client with synergy 1.3.1.  I updated SynergyKm to 1.3.1 as well.

I get the connection refused  problem with SynergyKM  of using the default port 24800.  I tried everything and no luck yet   What to do ?? Tks]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I ran into the same problem.  I have synergy installed on computers at work and at home and use two separate config files, so I wrote two small shell scripts on my mac (the server) to start the sever inside of a detached screen:

/usr/local/bin/start_synergy_home:
screen -dmS synergy_home_server /usr/local/bin/synergys --config /usr/local/etc/synergy-home.conf -f

/usr/local/bin/start_synergy_work:
screen -dmS synergy_work_server /usr/local/bin/synergys --config /usr/local/etc/synergy-work.conf -f

At home, I just run start_synergy_home, and at work, I run start_synergy_work, and it loads the proper configs so I&#039;m good to go.

If you need to see the output for some reason, you just do `screen -r synergy_home_server`

Hope it helps someone.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[chris:  maybe some more information about your set up would help.  I just this got my iMac running as the server and connecting to an Ubuntu server, a Mandrake server and a Windows laptop (one of them through a dmz pinhole  on my firewall).

Are you sure your timeout problem isn&#039;t due to a firewall issue (mine was).

Have you tried using synergy -f -d DEBUG2 to get more info about what&#039;s happening?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi, done a awesome work. Synergy has only been extensively tested on Linux which make the my work more easier. Thank you for the blog posted. The Mac OS X port is incomplete. It does not synchronize the screen saver. Therefore in this case Synergy as helped me a lot with its special features.
SynergyKM was previously hosted on a personal server and I decided to move it here in coming week. Hopefully it will give the project more visibility and provide better tools to maintain it.
Thank U.]]></description>
