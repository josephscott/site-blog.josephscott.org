					<description><![CDATA[I think it goes beyond just having support for booting FW devices in the BIOS.  For instance, I&#039;ve never seen any Windows backup software that claims to be able to make a bootable backup.

On a Mac I can make a backup to an external drive, pull the internal drive out of the system entirely and boot using the external drive.  I don&#039;t have to touch any system files, it just runs.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks Joseph!

&#062; I do regular backups to external FireWire 800 drives, which are bootable. I would love to be able to do something like that under Windows.

I currently do this on my laptop (Sony Vaio) - I have multiple drives instead of partitions and boot a different OS or backup files from them. I think the key is getting a BIOS that supports the FW boot.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@Scott

I&#039;ve been using Mac OS X as my main dev system for a few years now and have enjoyed it much more than Windows.  And with the move to x86 hardware I can still run XP under Parallels any time that I need.

I just wish the annoying behaviors in could be changed.

As for Time Machine, I don&#039;t have a big use for it.  I do regular backups to external FireWire 800 drives, which are bootable.  I would love to be able to do something like that under Windows.

For servers though, I still love my FreeBSD :-)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve played with Leopard for a few days now, and is it me, or is it a close knockoff to Solaris/Any favorite Linux distribution? I&#039;d almost rather use Ubuntu than Leopard. I mean spaces has been around forever, rsync instead of Time Machine, and I just hate browsing in the Applications dir for the programs I haven&#039;t docked yet. I wish there was a Win key + E alternative to getting to browsing the files system, like there is in XP too.

I&#039;m not against X, as a matter of fact, that&#039;s the only laptop or desktop that I&#039;d put money towards right now for a family computer. But I find myself more productive in XP/Vista/Ubuntu after trying Leopard.

Don&#039;t flame me too hard ;)]]></description>
