					<description><![CDATA[OK, got it ... EIP&#039;s really lovely, good on you. Those previous blog posts really tell the story. (I hope you splice them into the new site real soon.)

Marvelous ... now, let&#039;s have it accept HTML. *rolls up sleeves*]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[But ... but ... but the site says almost nothing about what it is!

I&#039;m looking for a GPL editor I can use in a CMS. Your site showed up in google so I was happy to see this post. I went to your new site (very handsome, BTW) and ... it&#039;s as though the site was created for folk who already know all about it. No screenshots? Descriptions? I&#039;m not confused, I&#039;m just ... I haven&#039;t a clue what EditInPlace does! (Yes, I know, I should read the whole site. But that&#039;s not the point, right?)

cheers

					<description><![CDATA[Hi,

really nice script, your &quot;EditInPlace&quot;.
Yet, wouldn&#039;t it be even nicer, if the edit-feature would require a log-in?
Like calling the page e.g. &quot;editme.htm?user=roland&#038;password=secret&quot; ?
Now for me this would be a very very convenient thing, yet I&#039;m too dumb
to modify the script accordingly. Too bad, isn&#039;t it?

( -: roland :- )]]></description>
