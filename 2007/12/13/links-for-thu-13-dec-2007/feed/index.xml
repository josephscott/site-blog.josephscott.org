					<description><![CDATA[@Deane -

The quote is from an article that claims that the only advantage WordPress has was that it was open source and that now with MTOS there was no advantage.

I didn&#039;t take it as a dig on MT, but as a dig on the article.  It was funny in that context.  I should have resisted the urge to link to it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[That quote (not yours, I know) implying that Movable Type &quot;sucks&quot; is way, way off-base. I love WordPress and my company uses it as a base for dozens of projects, but Movable Type is still a hell of a piece of software.  The odd use of Perl aside, MT is one of the most well-written and well-designed platforms I&#039;ve ever used.]]></description>
