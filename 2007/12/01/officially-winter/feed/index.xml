No need for fake snow here, even though it has been melting away, forecast calls for more this weekend.

We&#039;ve got this stuff called IceMelt, which does a pretty good job of keeping the ice away.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[OMG, great pictures.  It&#039;s nothing like that here in Northern Cali - doesn&#039;t feel much like the Christmas season.  I&#039;m from the East Coast so remember growing up playing in the snow.  They had a holiday festival downtown this past weekend where they brought in fake snow so the kids could play in it.  Hilarious!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Go crazy and get an ATV with a blade for pushing the snow out of the way. Less work than a blower, and with the same quality. Just a little more pricey, but it *guarantees* that you&#039;ll want to get out and shovel that snow ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Very picturesque, but I highly recommend the snow blower. (First thing that came to my mind when I saw your footprints in the driveway was, &quot;I bet he posted this *before* he got to shovel off all that snow!&quot;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@Deane -

I don&#039;t have a snow blower yet (going to have to get one though), but a neighbor was kind enough to do my driveway and walkway while doing his.

@Acrobatic -

Yeah, yeah, rub it in :-)]]></description>
