Like dousing a fire with gasoline, this makes matters worse, much worse.\u201d [The Mythical Man Month]\n\u201cMen and months are interchangeable commodities only when a task can be partitioned among many workers with no communication among them.\u201d [The Mythical Man Month]\n\u201cThe bearing of a child takes nine months, no matter how many women are assigned.\u201d [The Mythical Man Month]\n\u201cThe added burden of communication is made up of two parts, training and intercommunication.\u201d [The Mythical Man Month]\n\u201c\u2026testing is usually the most mis-scheduled part of programming.\u201d [The Mythical Man Month]\n\u201cIt is very difficult to make a vigorous, plausible, and job risking defense of an estimate that is derived by no quantitative method, supported by little data, and certified chiefly by the hunches of the managers.\u201d [The Mythical Man Month]\n\u201cMore software projects have gone awry for lack of calendar time than for all other causes combined.\u201d [The Mythical Man Month]\n\u201cFor efficiency and conceptual integrity, one prefers a few good minds doing design and construction.\u201d [The Surgical Team]\n\u201c\u2026a sharp distinction must be made between architecture and implementation, and the system architect must confine himself scrupulously to architecture.\u201d [The Surgical Team]\n\u201c\u2026conceptual integrity is the most important consideration in system design.\u201d [Aristocracy, Democracy, and System Design]\n\u201cIf a system is to have conceptual integrity, someone must control the concepts.\u201d [Aristocracy, Democracy, and System Design]\n\u201cExperience shows the opposite, that the integral system goes together faster and takes less time to test.\u201d [Aristocracy, Democracy, and System Design]\n\u201cThe general tendency is to over-design the second system, using all the ideas and frills that were cautiously sidetracked on the first one.\u201d [The Second-System Effect]\n\u201cEvery development organization needs such an independent technical auditing group to keep it honest.\u201d [Passing The Word]\n\u201cOrganizations must be designed around the people available; not people that fitted into pure-theory organizations.\u201d [Why did the Tower of Babel Fail?]\n\u201c\u2026the producer must have a high respect for the director\u2019s technical prowess.\u201d [Why did the Tower of Babel Fail?]\n\u201cThe techniques of communication and organization demand from the manager much thought and as much experienced competence as the software technology itself.\u201d [Why did the Tower of Babel Fail?]\nOn the Faultiness of Extrapolation -- \u201cExtrapolation of times for the hundred-yard dash shows that a man can run a mile in under three minutes.\u201d [Calling The Shot]\n\u201c\u2026his teams were only realizing 60 percent of the working week as actual programming and debugging time.  Machine downtime, higher-priority short unrelated jobs, meetings, paperwork, company business, sickness, personal time, etc.  accounted for the rest.\u201d [Calling The Shot]\n\u201cProgramming productivity may be increased as much as five times when a suitable high-level language is used.\u201d [Calling The Shot]\n\u201cFostering a total-system, user-oriented attitude may well be the most important function of the programming manager.\u201d [Ten pounds in a five pound sack]\n\u201cMuch more often, strategic breakthrough will come from redoing the representation of the data or tables.\u201d [Ten pounds in a five pound sack]\nOn having formal documents: \u201cOnly when one writes do the gaps appear and the inconsistencies protrude.\u201d, \u201c\u2026the documents will communicate the decisions to others.\u201d, \u201c\u2026a manager\u2019s documents give him a data base and check list.\u201d [The Documentary Hypothesis]\n\u201cIn most projects, the first system built is barely usable.\u201d [Plan To Throw One Away]\n\u201cAnd both the actual need and the user\u2019s perception of that need will change as programs are built, tested, and used.\u201d [Plan To Throw One Away]\n\u201cThe fundamental problem with program maintenance is that fixing a defect has a substantial (20-50 percent) chance of introducing another.\u201d [Plan To Throw One Away]\n\u201c\u2026the repairer is usually not the man who wrote the code, and often he is a junior programmer or trainee.\u201d [Plan To Throw One Away]\n\u201cTheoretically, after each fix one must run the entire bank of test cases previously run against the system, to ensure that it has not been damaged in an obscure way.\u201d [Plan To Throw One Away]\n\u201c\u2026sustained concentration reduces thinking time.\u201d [Sharp Tools]\n\u201cI am convinced that interactive systems will never displace batch systems for many applications.\u201d [Sharp Tools]\n\u201cThe crucial task is to get the product defined.\u201d V.A. Vyssotsky [The Whole and the Parts]\n\u201cLong before any code exists, the specification must be handed to an outside testing group to be scrutinized for completeness and clarity.\u201d [The Whole and the Parts]\n\u201c\u2026the partitioning and independence of modules avoids system bugs.\u201d [The Whole and the Parts]\n\u201cOne does not know all the expected effects of known bugs.\u201d [The Whole and the Parts]\n\u201c\u2026no one enjoys bearing bad news, either, so it gets softened without any real intent to deceive.\u201d [Hatching a Catastrophe]\n\u201c\u2026when the manager knows his boss will accept status reports without panic or preemption, he comes to give honest appraisals.\u201d  [Hatching a Catastrophe]\n\u201cMost programs don\u2019t need flow charts at all; few programs need more than a one-page flow chart.\u201d [The Other Face]\n\u201cThe detailed blow-by-blow flow chart, however, is an obsolete nuisance, suitable only for initiating beginners into algorithmic thinking.\u201d [The Other Face]\n\u201cSo labels, declaration statements, and symbolic names are all harnessed to the task of conveying as much meaning as possible to the reader.  A second notion is to use space and format as much as possible to improve readability and show subordination and nesting.\u201d [The Other Face]\n\u201cUse line comments or remark anything that is not obvious.\u201d [The Other Face]\n\u201cThere is no single development, in either technology or management technique, which by itself promises even one order of magnitude improvement in productivity, in reliability, in simplicity.\u201d [No Silver Bullet]\n\u201cThat very step, the beginning of hope, in itself dashed all hopes of magical solutions.\u201d [No Silver Bullet]\n\u201cI believe the hard part of building software to be the specification, design, and testing of this conceptual construct, no the labor of representing it and testing the fidelity of the representation.\u201d [No Silver Bullet]\n\u201cAll successful software gets changed.\u201d [No Silver Bullet]\n\u201cMany students of the art hold out more hope for object-oriented programming than for any of the other technical fads of the day.\u201d  [No Silver Bullet]\n[On expert systems] \u201cI believe the most important advance offered by the technology is the separation of the application complexity from the program itself.\u201d [No Silver Bullet]\n\u201cThe gap between the best software engineering practice and the average practice is very wide \u2026\u201d [No Silver Bullet]\n\u201cThe development of the mass market is, I believe, the most profound long\u2013run trend in software engineering.\u201d  [No Silver Bullet]\n\u201cThe hardest single part of building a software system is deciding precisely what to build.\u201d [No Silver Bullet]\n\u201cSound methodology can empower and liberate the creative mind; it cannot enflame or inspire the drudge.\u201d [No Silver Bullet]\n\u201cIt seems very unlikely that uncoordinated works of many minds should have enough coherence to be exactly described by general rules.\u201d [No Silver Bullet Refired]\n\u201c\u2026pipe dreaming inhibits forward progress and wastes effort.\u201d [No Silver Bullet Refired]\n\u201cFocus on quality, and productivity will follow.\u201d Capers Jones  [No Silver Bullet Refired]\n\u201c\u2026productivity drops again as one pursues extreme quality, as in IBM\u2019s space-shuttle shoftware.\u201d [No Silver Bullet Refired]\n\u201cThe development of the mass market is \u2026 the most profound long-run trend in software engineering.\u201d [No Silver Bullet Refired]\n\u201cUnless we teach people how to design, the languages matter very little.\u201d \u2013 David Parnas quoted in [No Silver Bullet Refired]\n\u201cObject-oriented techniques will not make the first project development any faster, or the next one.  The fifth one in that family will go blazingly fast.\u201d James Coggins quoted in [No Silver Bullet Refired]\n\u201c\u2026it requires real managerial courage a commodity much scarcer than technical competence of administrative proficiency.\u201d [No Silver Bullet Refired]\n\u201cVocabulary learning constitutes no small part of the intellectual barrier to reuse.\u201d  [No Silver Bullet Refired]\n\u201cAdding people to a software project increases the total effort necessary in three ways: the work and disruption of repartitioning itself, training the new people and added intercommunication.\u201d [Propositions of The Mythical Man Month]\n\u201c\u2026parts should be encapsulated so that no one needs to or is allowed to see the internals of any parts other than his own, but should see only the interfaces.\u201d  [Propositions of The Mythical Man Month]\n\u201cConceptual integrity is central to product quality.  Having a system architect is the most important single step toward conceptual integrity.\u201d [The Mythical Man Month after 20 Years]\n\u201cThe biggest mistake in the \u2018Build one to throw away\u2019 concept is that it implicitly assumes the classical sequential or waterfall model of software construction.\u201d [The Mythical Man Month after 20 Years]\n\u201cHardly any projects succeed in less than \u00be of the calculated optimum schedule, regardless of the number of people applied.\u201d [The Mythical Man Month after 20 Years]\n\u201c\u2026adding extra manpower early in the schedule is a much safer maneuver than adding it later\u2026\u201d [The Mythical Man Month after 20 Years]\n\u201c\u2026new people added late in a development project must be team players willing to pitch and work within the process, and not attempt to alter or improve the process itself!\u201d [The Mythical Man Month after 20 Years]\n\u201c..the quality of the people on a project, and their organization and management, are much more important factors in success than are the tools they use or the technical approaches they take.\u201d [The Mythical Man Month after 20 Years]\n\u201c\u2026creativity comes from individuals and not from structures or processes\u2026\u201d [The Mythical Man Month after 20 Years]",

Machine downtime, higher-priority short unrelated jobs, meetings, paperwork, company business, sickness, personal time, etc.  accounted for the rest.\u201d [Calling The Shot]\n\u201cProgramming productivity may be increased as much as five times when a suitable high-level language is used.\u201d [Calling The Shot]\n\u201cFostering a total-system, user-oriented attitude may well be the most important function of the programming manager.\u201d [Ten pounds in a five pound sack]\n\u201cMuch more often, strategic breakthrough will come from redoing the representation of the data or tables.\u201d [Ten pounds in a five pound sack]\nOn having formal documents: \u201cOnly when one writes do the gaps appear and the inconsistencies protrude.\u201d, \u201c\u2026the documents will communicate the decisions to others.\u201d, \u201c\u2026a manager\u2019s documents give him a data base and check list.\u201d [The Documentary Hypothesis]\n\u201cIn most projects, the first system built is barely usable.\u201d [Plan To Throw One Away]\n\u201cAnd both the actual need and the user\u2019s perception of that need will change as programs are built, tested, and used.\u201d [Plan To Throw One Away]\n\u201cThe fundamental problem with program maintenance is that fixing a defect has a substantial (20-50 percent) chance of introducing another.\u201d [Plan To Throw One Away]\n\u201c\u2026the repairer is usually not the man who wrote the code, and often he is a junior programmer or trainee.\u201d [Plan To Throw One Away]\n\u201cTheoretically, after each fix one must run the entire bank of test cases previously run against the system, to ensure that it has not been damaged in an obscure way.\u201d [Plan To Throw One Away]\n\u201c\u2026sustained concentration reduces thinking time.\u201d [Sharp Tools]\n\u201cI am convinced that interactive systems will never displace batch systems for many applications.\u201d [Sharp Tools]\n\u201cThe crucial task is to get the product defined.\u201d V.A. Vyssotsky [The Whole and the Parts]\n\u201cLong before any code exists, the specification must be handed to an outside testing group to be scrutinized for completeness and clarity.\u201d [The Whole and the Parts]\n\u201c\u2026the partitioning and independence of modules avoids system bugs.\u201d [The Whole and the Parts]\n\u201cOne does not know all the expected effects of known bugs.\u201d [The Whole and the Parts]\n\u201c\u2026no one enjoys bearing bad news, either, so it gets softened without any real intent to deceive.\u201d [Hatching a Catastrophe]\n\u201c\u2026when the manager knows his boss will accept status reports without panic or preemption, he comes to give honest appraisals.\u201d  [Hatching a Catastrophe]\n\u201cMost programs don\u2019t need flow charts at all; few programs need more than a one-page flow chart.\u201d [The Other Face]\n\u201cThe detailed blow-by-blow flow chart, however, is an obsolete nuisance, suitable only for initiating beginners into algorithmic thinking.\u201d [The Other Face]\n\u201cSo labels, declaration statements, and symbolic names are all harnessed to the task of conveying as much meaning as possible to the reader.  A second notion is to use space and format as much as possible to improve readability and show subordination and nesting.\u201d [The Other Face]\n\u201cUse line comments or remark anything that is not obvious.\u201d [The Other Face]\n\u201cThere is no single development, in either technology or management technique, which by itself promises even one order of magnitude improvement in productivity, in reliability, in simplicity.\u201d [No Silver Bullet]\n\u201cThat very step, the beginning of hope, in itself dashed all hopes of magical solutions.\u201d [No Silver Bullet]\n\u201cI believe the hard part of building software to be the specification, design, and testing of this conceptual construct, no the labor of representing it and testing the fidelity of the representation.\u201d [No Silver Bullet]\n\u201cAll successful software gets changed.\u201d [No Silver Bullet]\n\u201cMany students of the art hold out more hope for object-oriented programming than for any of the other technical fads of the day.\u201d  [No Silver Bullet]\n[On expert systems] \u201cI believe the most important advance offered by the technology is the separation of the application complexity from the program itself.\u201d [No Silver Bullet]\n\u201cThe gap between the best software engineering practice and the average practice is very wide \u2026\u201d [No Silver Bullet]\n\u201cThe development of the mass market is, I believe, the most profound long\u2013run trend in software engineering.\u201d  [No Silver Bullet]\n\u201cThe hardest single part of building a software system is deciding precisely what to build.\u201d [No Silver Bullet]\n\u201cSound methodology can empower and liberate the creative mind; it cannot enflame or inspire the drudge.\u201d [No Silver Bullet]\n\u201cIt seems very unlikely that uncoordinated works of many minds should have enough coherence to be exactly described by general rules.\u201d [No Silver Bullet Refired]\n\u201c\u2026pipe dreaming inhibits forward progress and wastes effort.\u201d [No Silver Bullet Refired]\n\u201cFocus on quality, and productivity will follow.\u201d Capers Jones  [No Silver Bullet Refired]\n\u201c\u2026productivity drops again as one pursues extreme quality, as in IBM\u2019s space-shuttle shoftware.\u201d [No Silver Bullet Refired]\n\u201cThe development of the mass market is \u2026 the most profound long-run trend in software engineering.\u201d [No Silver Bullet Refired]\n\u201cUnless we teach people how to design, the languages matter very little.\u201d \u2013 David Parnas quoted in [No Silver Bullet Refired]\n\u201cObject-oriented techniques will not make the first project development any faster, or the next one.  The fifth one in that family will go blazingly fast.\u201d James Coggins quoted in [No Silver Bullet Refired]\n\u201c\u2026it requires real managerial courage a commodity much scarcer than technical competence of administrative proficiency.\u201d [No Silver Bullet Refired]\n\u201cVocabulary learning constitutes no small part of the intellectual barrier to reuse.\u201d  [No Silver Bullet Refired]\n\u201cAdding people to a software project increases the total effort necessary in three ways: the work and disruption of repartitioning itself, training the new people and added intercommunication.\u201d [Propositions of The Mythical Man Month]\n\u201c\u2026parts should be encapsulated so that no one needs to or is allowed to see the internals of any parts other than his own, but should see only the interfaces.\u201d  [Propositions of The Mythical Man Month]\n\u201cConceptual integrity is central to product quality.  Having a system architect is the most important single step toward conceptual integrity.\u201d [The Mythical Man Month after 20 Years]\n\u201cThe biggest mistake in the \u2018Build one to throw away\u2019 concept is that it implicitly assumes the classical sequential or waterfall model of software construction.\u201d [The Mythical Man Month after 20 Years]\n\u201cHardly any projects succeed in less than \u00be of the calculated optimum schedule, regardless of the number of people applied.\u201d [The Mythical Man Month after 20 Years]\n\u201c\u2026adding extra manpower early in the schedule is a much safer maneuver than adding it later\u2026\u201d [The Mythical Man Month after 20 Years]\n\u201c\u2026new people added late in a development project must be team players willing to pitch and work within the process, and not attempt to alter or improve the process itself!\u201d [The Mythical Man Month after 20 Years]\n\u201c..the quality of the people on a project, and their organization and management, are much more important factors in success than are the tools they use or the technical approaches they take.\u201d [The Mythical Man Month after 20 Years]\n\u201c\u2026creativity comes from individuals and not from structures or processes\u2026\u201d [The Mythical Man Month after 20 Years]",
