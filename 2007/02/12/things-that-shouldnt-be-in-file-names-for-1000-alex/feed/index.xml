					<description><![CDATA[Once I was performing a GUI-based install of some software and got an error pop-up telling me &quot;C:Program not found&quot;. I see no good reason to put the default separator smack in the middle of a file name. One of the team&#039;s favorites around here is a name like &quot;my file  .doc&quot; ... Yuck!

I had a colleague that once put a space in the host name of his windows computer and claimed it broke things so badly he had to reinstall the OS.

2) Which cases is upper case justifiable? Do you mean jsut README-like, or even for say, names of people?

Tnx for a nice article]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Another nice way, in linux or unix, to find and get rid of files with problem characters is to run &quot;ps -i&quot; to note the &quot;inode number of the file.  Then (making sure you&#039;re in the directory you want to delete the file name from, since inode numbers aren&#039;t unique across partition) running something like:

find . -inum 5678 -exec rm {} ;

It almost always works, but I almost always use it a last resort, also :)

Nice post!
