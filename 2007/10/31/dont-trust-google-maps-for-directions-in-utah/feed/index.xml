I ran a couple of the addresses that Google Maps failed on through maps.live.com and it got one right and one wrong.  Still better is better odds than with Google at this point :-)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve had trouble with Google Maps as well. In Utah county, they changed the exit numbers on I-15. Google doesn&#039;t have the new exit numbers in their system yet, so you can end up getting off the freeway too early (or too late). If you watch the mileage instead of the exit numbers, the directions are spot on, though.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The problem is that the exits for I15 in Google are all misaligned. This stems from I-15 being redone for the Olympics back in 2001-2002. The redone highway varies slightly from what was there before but they didn&#039;t change the  exit numbers. So for people exit 279 is still 279 but Google looks at it and says - no, there is actually an exit at 236 (or something like that - I can&#039;t remember exactly how it works but if you have to go north past bountiful or south around the point of the mountain watch for exit street names, not the exit number).]]></description>
