The redone highway varies slightly from what was there before but they didn't change the  exit numbers. So for people exit 279 is still 279 but Google looks at it and says - no, there is actually an exit at 236 (or something like that - I can't remember exactly how it works but if you have to go north past bountiful or south around the point of the mountain watch for exit street names, not the exit number).",
