					<description><![CDATA[Dude! No wonder you missed the last demolition party. I checked your blog before I sent you the invite, but I guess I must have missed this post.

So nothing equivalent to Fry&#039;s, eh? The *really* important question is, do they have a Mongolian BBQ anywhere nearby?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[As someone who married a girl from Sac, I have much lamented the complete lack of anything in Utah even remotely close to the grandeur of Fry&#039;s Electronics. Best Buy is about as close as you&#039;re going to get. Sorry.

FWIW, there are some pretty good groups around here, from what I&#039;ve heard. There is the Utah PHP Users&#039; group: http://uphpu.org/

You can also check out the page for Provo Linux Users&#039; Group, which has links to just about every other major group in the state: http://www.plug.org/]]></description>
