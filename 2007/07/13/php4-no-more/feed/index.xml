					<description><![CDATA[Totally agree about the &quot;wait for PHP6&quot; statement. I found that almost all my old code just worked straight away when moving to PHP5, so the only thing holding everyone back is the web hosts who don&#039;t want to upgrade.

I&#039;m sure this will convince many to move to PHP5, but then we may have to wait a few more years for them to go to PHP6.
