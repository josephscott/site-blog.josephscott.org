Expect to go quite a ways -- it wicks through the pad like crazy.\n\nRip out the wet pad.  Throw it away.\n\nGo buy a bunch of five gallon buckets.  You can get them for $3 each at Home Depot.\n\nTurn the buckets upside down on the concrete, then drag the carpet back over them.  This \"tents\" the carpet and gets it off the floor.\n\nGet every fan you can find, and shoot air under the carpet.  Leave it like this for three or four days.  About day two, it will start to smell really musty.  But it gets better.\n\nPeel some baseboard back and see if it's wet back there.  Ours wasn't but you have to be worried about mold if you find water.\n\nGet a carpet installer in, have him put down new pad and tack the carpet back down.\n\nHave the carpets professionally cleaned.\n\nIt took us about three weeks from start to finished to get back to normal.",
