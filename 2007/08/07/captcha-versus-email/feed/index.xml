					<description><![CDATA[in reality it&#039;s not versus its really a join of the two ideas.

Without a captcha posting automated comments would be to easy.
I could also easily write a cron job to check my mailbox ... local system cat + grep + wget and visit the url&#039;s to common blogs i want to spam.

CAPTCHA and Email  now thats a nice concept.  I plan on implementing this for non logged in users.

The captcha would be needed on initial posting of comment and after the user visits the url.  to avoid a simple wget script.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think captch is less annoying, as you see the alphanumeric data on the same page and need to enter it in the box.
But the email. You have to open a new window, login to your email account, click on the link, and then the comment is activated.

But I think email blocks more spam than captcha.]]></description>
