Please see my post on Dell.  http://mayadesai.wordpress.com/2007/04/26/dell/\nAnyway, this isn't the first time they've called to verify the shipping address at odd hours accompanied by insane other questions like \"Why are you ordering this?\", \"Why is the shipping address different from the billing address?\",  \"At which address do you live?\",  \"Why do you live at neither the shipping or billing address?\", \"What is your relationship to the person you're having it shipped to?\"  Apparently when the shipping address is not the same as the billing it causes mass confusion at Dell and warrants a call from the fraud department before dawn.\nEvery time I order from Dell I always expect some problem to arise so just pray that you get your computer safe and sound!",
