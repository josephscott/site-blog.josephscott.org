					<description><![CDATA[Oh no Dell, not again.  Please see my post on Dell.  http://mayadesai.wordpress.com/2007/04/26/dell/
Anyway, this isn&#039;t the first time they&#039;ve called to verify the shipping address at odd hours accompanied by insane other questions like &quot;Why are you ordering this?&quot;, &quot;Why is the shipping address different from the billing address?&quot;,  &quot;At which address do you live?&quot;,  &quot;Why do you live at neither the shipping or billing address?&quot;, &quot;What is your relationship to the person you&#039;re having it shipped to?&quot;  Apparently when the shipping address is not the same as the billing it causes mass confusion at Dell and warrants a call from the fraud department before dawn.
Every time I order from Dell I always expect some problem to arise so just pray that you get your computer safe and sound!]]></description>
