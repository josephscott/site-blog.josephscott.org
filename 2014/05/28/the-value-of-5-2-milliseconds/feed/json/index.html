            "content_html": "You are right, I was just making a comparison, not knowing if that specific cable would be used by regular \"internet traffic\".\n\nYet, as the explosion of the 1st bublle showed us: once the infrastructure is there, it will stay, no matter what happens to the rest of the economy. So, of course it's now being used by \"private\" links, but eventually, I bet that it will be used for other purposes. It reminds me of offshor oil platforms which are used by about 4 types of oil extraction company in their whole \"life\": the first one are the \"cleanest\" because ehy suck the \"high quality\" oil and then as the quality of the oild decreases, the margin decreases as well so the exploiting company is less and less careful about its impact, security... etc.\n\nSame goes with airplanes. They get a 20 life with the \"high end\" airlines, and then move to the developing country for another 20 year life (it's just a quick paint job that you can witness on the Jakarta airport).",

I wasn't able to find a direct confirmation, but it was implied that this new link would be a private pay connection and not for general Internet use.\n\nIf that is the case that this new link will be limited to just private customers then the comparison to Amazon and 100ms impact on revenue doesn't really line up.  Instead the comparison is about being able to execute trades faster than those without access to this new line.  Good or not that certainly has value to some people, see all the recent arguments over the claims in the book Flash Boys.",
