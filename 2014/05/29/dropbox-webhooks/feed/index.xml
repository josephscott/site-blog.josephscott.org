It definitely presents a specific category of issues.  You&#039;ve got things like retry tracking and back off, and the always painful timeout issues.

While probably not at the same scale, another service that would be interesting in that area is Stripe.com.  I&#039;m sure they&#039;ve had to build up a specific set of infrastructure items to deal with their webhook notifications.]]></description>
