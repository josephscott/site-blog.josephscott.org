I may look at upgraded to Nginx 1.6 and then enabling it again, see if that makes any difference.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[If you are inclined to do it again, I would love to see it in action. SPDY is still relatively new and it certainly could be that in some situations, it is actually slower or just plain contraindicated. With your site, you have very few assets, so it is possible that SPDY would provide little gains.]]></description>

I did run multiple tests, and the page load time was always slower with SPDY.  It was a result I was surprised by as well.

It could be anything though, including the low end VM that I&#039;m using at DigitalOcean.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Joseph!

I&#039;m flummoxed. What metric were you using to test this? How did you test it? Did you run multiple tests?

I would love to see you turn it back on so I can poke at it ;) I&#039;m just not convinced that it would be slower.]]></description>
