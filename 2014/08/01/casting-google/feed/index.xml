I&#039;m not sure what to make of Google+ as a product.  I created a few circles, added a few people to them, but never really used it much.  One thing that did happen is I stopped used Picasa because the merge with Google+ made it too confusing to tell what was going to happen with my photos.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[If that&#039;s true (and I believe there is some truth to it), I&#039;m astonished by Google&#039;s repeated failure at social... I&#039;m also very surprised by the lack of vision. To this day, G+ is merely a copycat of what other social networks are (Facebook or Twitter)... rather than something new.

Finally, I have a thought for all this product that were killed by G+&#039;s requirements in terms of development effort and growth relays: Gchat or Reader come to mind.]]></description>
