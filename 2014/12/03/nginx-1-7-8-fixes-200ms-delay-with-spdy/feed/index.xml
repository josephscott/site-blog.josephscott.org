					<description><![CDATA[Wow, thanks so much for writing this article! I finally got to put SPDY on a server, and noticed that the TTFB was actually pretty bad. After Googling for awhile I stumbled onto this. I was extremely skeptical that this was actually my problem. But I was using Nginx 1.6 so I figured I might as well upgrade to 1.7. As soon as I did, webpagetest started giving me As for TTFB. Crazy.

Thanks again!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I forget to thank you for the article. So thank you for that.
Btw The Nginx team is going to evaluate the case, see:

&quot;We will discuss merging this code to 1.6 for the next release but we
don&#039;t have a schedule for 1.6.3 yet.&quot; - Maxim Konovalov]]></description>

I don&#039;t know what the Nginx back porting policy is ( or if they have one ).  I agree that it would definitely be helpful for those still using the 1.6.x versions.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks Joseph for your fast reply,

I have asked the Nginx developers to make a patch for Nginx 1.6. 
This is a major loss of function and a critical bug, if you ask me, 
because the existing 1.6. tcp_nodelay won&#039;t work as it should be.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[[&#8230;] Now that we have seen why the components of TCP lets see how their interaction causes a deadlock.Instead of a contrived example to demonstrate this classic problem , lets take a look at this problem in the wild.
