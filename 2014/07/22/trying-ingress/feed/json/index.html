It's a game that changes your playing over time so don't treat your initial experience as the summary of the game. As you play,  most people focus on the points in the levels, but if you focus on the badges you will automatically level up and accumulate the points you need. As you play,  the game shifts and changes but only in your mind, which is why it is so popular for intellectuals. It also has a fantastic community so I encourage you to join your local Ingress Google+ group and expand the possibilities as it is a highly social game and it's very hard to accomplish much without other players.\n\nHave fun and welcome to Ingress.\n\nAnd I highly recommend a really good battery pack for two. There are some ways to reduce the battery drain like turning off the sound and turning off notifications and lowering the light level.",
