Haha, no, I went with: j9t

My choice of teams was based purely on the number of green vs. blue portals I saw around my neighborhood.  I wanted an opportunity to attack stuff without having to walk too far.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey, so is your agent name &quot;stilts&quot;? I have been playing since December and am currently waiting for one more badge for level 14. I have met so many great people playing this game, if it really is a game. I would have pegged you as Enlightened though.  Btw, &quot;thejoker&quot; was already taken so I became &quot;rekojeht&quot;.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Excellent! If you need some help just let me know.  I&#039;m level 10 and my husband&#039;s level 11 and we&#039;ve been playing It all over the world in our travels.  It&#039;s a game that changes your playing over time so don&#039;t treat your initial experience as the summary of the game. As you play,  most people focus on the points in the levels, but if you focus on the badges you will automatically level up and accumulate the points you need. As you play,  the game shifts and changes but only in your mind, which is why it is so popular for intellectuals. It also has a fantastic community so I encourage you to join your local Ingress Google+ group and expand the possibilities as it is a highly social game and it&#039;s very hard to accomplish much without other players.

Have fun and welcome to Ingress.

And I highly recommend a really good battery pack for two. There are some ways to reduce the battery drain like turning off the sound and turning off notifications and lowering the light level.]]></description>
