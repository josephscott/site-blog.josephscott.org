It is a goal for the Memcache plugins but not for us. We need proper APIs before we can fiddle with performance.  \n\nThe transport impacts network traffic but not so much query execution performance.  Inside MySQL its the same code for running SQL thus the same overall performance can be expected.\n\nThe Memcache plugins hint the best possible performance. If you want to see how MySQL compares to a NoSQL Key-Value store, use the Memcache plugins for benchmarking.  Then, add a bit to the Memcache plugins due to the more verbose HTTP protocol to extrapolate what might be possible after hefty optimizations. The Memcache plugins are ~2x as fast as comparable SQL request because they bypass the SQL layers inside MySQL. In 2004 I learned MySQL spents ~50% of the total runtime of a simple SELECT for parsing SQL and \"overhead\" - that's still the case, thus the 100% speedup (~2x as fast) with the InnoDB Memcache plugin.\n\nThe 1.0.0 maps all requests to SQL. After all its just a convenience feature for those who do not want to write a HTTP -&gt; MySQL proxy themselves. We did not do any benchmarking. We only did a quick sanity check on a laptop checking HTTP Request -&gt; Apache -&gt; PHP (SELECT 1)  -&gt; MySQL vs.  HTTP Request -&gt; Plugin (SELECT 1) -&gt; MySQL. The Plugin won. If one removed the web server overhead and compared PHP/...(connect, SELECT 1, disconnect) -&gt; C/S Protocol -&gt; MySQL vs.  HTTP -&gt; Plugin(SELECT 1) -&gt; MySQL there should be no major difference.",
