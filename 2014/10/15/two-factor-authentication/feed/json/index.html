I'd go even further than that, my mobile device shouldn't need connectivity in order to generate a two factor token.\n\nIn most cases using something like the <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-authenticator/id388497605?mt=8\" rel=\"nofollow\">Google Authenticator app</a> is a much better option.",
