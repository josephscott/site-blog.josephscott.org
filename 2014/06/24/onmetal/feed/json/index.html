I.E. \"\"Auto Scaling allows you to scale your Amazon EC2 capacity up or down automatically according to conditions you define. With Auto Scaling, you can ensure that the number of Amazon EC2 instances you\u2019re using increases seamlessly during demand spikes to maintain performance, and decreases automatically during demand lulls to minimize costs.\"\" Can you do this with OnMetal? Thanks.",
