&lt;blockquote&gt;
many bloggers and creatives of all kind get lost in popularity since it’s far easier to measure
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

You are spot on with the ease of measurement being a major issue.  What we measure is something that we either already consider important, or will consider important in the future.

Which leaves the obvious question on the table.  How do measure how well you write?  At least in school you had a teacher who would grade it for you.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Another way of thinking about this is how one of the first questions bloggers ask is &quot;How do I get more traffic&quot;.  That&#039;s purely about popularity and often they&#039;re looking for plugins and technologies that will magically do this for them. 

it&#039;s rare to hear bloggers ask &quot;how can I improve my writing?&quot; or &quot;How I can pick more important and interesting topics?&quot;

The former is about popularity, the later is about quality. 

I agree with you it&#039;s possible to seek both (there are 4 quadrants: popular and good, popular and not good, not popular and good, and not popular and not good) - but many bloggers and creatives of all kind get lost in popularity since it&#039;s far easier to measure.]]></description>
