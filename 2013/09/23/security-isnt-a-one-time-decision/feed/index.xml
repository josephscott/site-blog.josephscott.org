Definitely, the inability to change our fingerprints is good and bad.

The trade off analysis is also relative though.  Is having no passcode or fingerprint requirement on an iPhone 5s ( the method most people reportedly use ) better or worse security than just requiring a fingerprint?  At a high level I&#039;d usually say worse, but that isn&#039;t always the case.  If it leads to an over confidence and poor analysis of the possible trade offs it could be better to go with out.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[As you said, security is about trade offs. There is no such thing as  100% secure, which is why revocation of security credentials is important. 
The scary thing about biometrics is that they can&#039;t be revoked.]]></description>
