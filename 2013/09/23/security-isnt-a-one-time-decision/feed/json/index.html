Is having no passcode or fingerprint requirement on an iPhone 5s ( the method most people reportedly use ) better or worse security than just requiring a fingerprint?  At a high level I'd usually say worse, but that isn't always the case.  If it leads to an over confidence and poor analysis of the possible trade offs it could be better to go with out.",
