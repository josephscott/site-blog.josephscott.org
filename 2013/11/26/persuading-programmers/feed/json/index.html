I think there is potential for tech to have a larger component of meritocracy that other sectors, but in some respects it has been oversold.",

The singlemost important factor for a web project to succeed is to be not too far from San Francisco, carried by someone who is in their twenties (or early thirties) and who worked with the right people in the past... a bit depressing.",
