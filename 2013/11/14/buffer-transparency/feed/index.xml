Oh there are definitely risks involved.  Went people aren&#039;t left to their own imaginations to come up with wild over the top numbers then reality might look significantly less exciting.

But then again must of this information is available for companies that have publicly traded stock.  In some cases public companies are even rewarded for not having profits (Amazon for instance).  There are any number of strange things that might come from sharing financial details when you are not legally obligated to do so.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s indeed fascinating. However, I think there is a very strong risk associated with that.
For example, someone could find their &quot;cash in the bank&quot; level to be quite low (about 45 days worth of revenues and probably not a lot more in terms of spendings). If that person is a potential customer, they may be worried about investing on the long term with Buffer, because they don&#039;t want to be in a situation where they depend too much on a &quot;fragile&quot; company.

Also a quick analysis shows that they&#039;re &#039;not pro&#039; revenues are growing by just 4%, which seems to be a significantly lower growth than in the previous month...]]></description>
