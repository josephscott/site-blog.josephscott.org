So far I haven&#039;t seen any particularly strong stabilizing elements in the Bitcoin economy.  Perhaps that might come from a few existing large institutions.]]></description>

Yeah, their other charts are better. That&#039;s why I further suggested bitcoincharts.com, which gives you more choices of exchanges (MtGX is always the highest). :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[There&#039;s also bitcoincharts.com

As far as volatility, you can say that again.
But at $600, it&#039;s still 3x over what it was right before it started rising sharply.
If you look at &quot;the previous BTC bubble&quot; (July 2013), it did about the same: from under $50 to $250 to just over $100. My bets are still on BTC being &quot;stable&quot; between $900-1000 by February.

But honestly, it&#039;s just playful speculation, since I didn&#039;t invest.
Not much of a gambler. :)]]></description>
