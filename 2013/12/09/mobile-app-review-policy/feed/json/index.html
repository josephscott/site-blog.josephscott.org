There is a boolean choice (Yes or No). If you click Yes, you're taken directly to the app store to rate and review. If you say 'No', rather than risk negative feedback left on the store they pop their own modal that goes directly to the developer for comment. Still super obtrusive and annoying. However, they fork the users and only prompt those who state they're having a good experience  to review.",
