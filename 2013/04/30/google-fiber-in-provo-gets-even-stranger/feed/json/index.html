If you assume that they are using VLANs without separate fiber, then that is only as secure as the devices implementing the VLANs.  But running over the same fiber has other problems.  It is one thing if a neighborhood looses Internet access because of a fiber cut, it is another thing if police loose a portion of their communication due to that same fiber cut.  Having separate fiber runs would reduce the collateral damage.\n\nNext, they already admitted that they didn't know where some of the fiber line actually was.  This is infrastructure that they are using for traffic signals and police, and they don't know where it is.  At least part of the reason for that is that iProvo infrastructure has had various owners over the years.  If there were separate fiber runs for traffic signals/police then then they wouldn't have to keep including those pieces in the sale of this infrastructure.\n\nJust because you can potentially use a single set of fiber infrastructure for everything, doesn't mean you should.  Having redundant connectivity for critical things like public services just makes sense, not having it is eventually asking for problems.",

You're confusing layer 1 with layer 3.\n\nIt's akin to complaining that your company's T1 runs on the same copper network as your neighbour's phone sex line. :)\n\nThe copper runs side by side, but there is no actual network crossover at all. Same in the case of this fiber. They'll just have built a big private ethernet/IP network with it to link up all of the city services. It's very standard, and quite secure.",

Could be that they don't I suppose.\n\nOn the $39M, I agree, and I think it is possible that Provo still comes out with a net win in all of this.  Won't know for sure for several years.",

From the outside it certainly seems like Provo could have received some amount greater that $1 from Google.\n\nI think there is a possibility that Provo still comes out ahead on the money issues after all of this.  Guess we won't really know for another 12 years when the bonds are paid off.  Of course by then Google may have sold the fiber network back to Provo for $1.  If that happens, well, who knows where it would end up.",
