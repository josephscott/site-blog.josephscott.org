We had our last two kids at the local hospital just a few miles down the road, both deliveries went smoothly.  We've made various trips to the local ER and urgent care offices over the years as well.\n\nAt least for my local experiences I'm happy with the services, though we haven't anything that I'd consider traumatic compared to what that article reviewed.  So my concern right now is less with the current experience of health care and more with the costs, and potential costs if something really major did happen in our family.\n\nI have a 40 year old friend who has a wife and 5 kids.  Late last year he was diagnosed with Leukemia.  For him and his family, being financially ruined by medical costs is their reality right now.",
