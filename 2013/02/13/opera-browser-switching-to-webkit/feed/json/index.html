I don't see either of them wanting to switch to WebKit.  I think Opera was able to justify this move in part because it frees up more of their people to make the parts of their browser surrounding the rendering engine better.",

I have however seen a lot of negativity from the Mozilla folks, or even TBL himself (thru a RT).\n\nWhat I find the most fascinating is that it will be completely transparent for Opera to move to Webkit just because the web was built on open protocols, with a strong decoupling between the browsers and the web apps. This kind of change would not be possible if the websites we use and love were built custom for a specific type of browser, OS or device. I just hope it stays the same, despite the strong temptation my many web devs to just add Webkit specific features to their apps.",
