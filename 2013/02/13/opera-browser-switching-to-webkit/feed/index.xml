					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;/2013/02/13/opera-browser-switching-to-webkit/#comment-3980&quot;&gt;julien51&lt;/a&gt;.

It does make me wonder what the internal discussions for Firefox and IE look like after this announcement.  I don&#039;t see either of them wanting to switch to WebKit.  I think Opera was able to justify this move in part because it frees up more of their people to make the parts of their browser surrounding the rendering engine better.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is indeed an interesting move. I have however seen a lot of negativity from the Mozilla folks, or even TBL himself (thru a RT).

What I find the most fascinating is that it will be completely transparent for Opera to move to Webkit just because the web was built on open protocols, with a strong decoupling between the browsers and the web apps. This kind of change would not be possible if the websites we use and love were built custom for a specific type of browser, OS or device. I just hope it stays the same, despite the strong temptation my many web devs to just add Webkit specific features to their apps.]]></description>
