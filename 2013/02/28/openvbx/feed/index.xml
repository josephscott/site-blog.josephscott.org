					<description><![CDATA[I dont know if you have been tracking with this app or not but it seems that perhaps it has not been touched in a while. The OpenVBX base works well but the ios app not so much. I rolled a solution to this that I want to make sure others know about. It does not touch openvbx at all but it does let you call from behind any twilio number or verified caller id - you may find it helpful at www.twidial.com

Thanks]]></description>
