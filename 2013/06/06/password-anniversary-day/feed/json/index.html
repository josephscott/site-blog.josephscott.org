All it does is if the DB is linked, there's an expiration date on how long the password will last, as you're well aware.\n\nWith that, I really like this idea. I'm generally not a fan of rotating passwords, but creating a \"Password Anniversary Day\" might raise enough awareness for all provides to either use bcrypt() or 5k key stretching rotations, complete with random salts.",
