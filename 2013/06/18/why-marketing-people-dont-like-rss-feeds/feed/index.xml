Stop trying to own them and make them feel like they own YOU
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

That should have been the TL;DR version of this post.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think the attitude of the &quot;RSS Is Dead&quot; people that bothers me the most is trying to &quot;own&quot; your subscribers. If you write good content, they will come, but you have to make it easy for them. I wouldn&#039;t say RSS is easy. It seems to be a power user type of thing, but making it difficult for any of your readers is counterproductive.

Hello, marketing people...

You don&#039;t own your subscribers. They are PEOPLE. Stop trying to own them and make them feel like they own YOU. If you aren&#039;t writing something that gets them to come back, then you lost them with or without an email address.]]></description>

So, we chose explictly to focus on services (apps) rather than channels (email, IM, web... etc), but yes, SubToMe is perfectly compatible with apps like http://blogtrottr.com/ for example which do send RSS via email.
I wish I could integrate with the WP reader too, because I know you can pick Email notifications (and even IM iirc!), but there is no way to currently redirect the user to a &#039;subscribe page&#039; directly. The user has to manually enter the url in http://wordpress.com/#!/read/edit/ which is sad. I wish there was something like http://wordpress.com/#!/read/edit/?url=https://josephscott.org/feed/ which would just prefill the url field. Let me know if you can help :)

Does subtome.com support subscribing via email as well?  For folks who are actively trying to kill off feeds, not having email subscription support would be a non-starter.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is exactly the reasoning behind subtome (http://subtome.com)/ : let the subscriber pick their tool and they&#039;ll be more faithful to your content!

I know I asked you before, but maybe in regards of this post your opinion changed?]]></description>
