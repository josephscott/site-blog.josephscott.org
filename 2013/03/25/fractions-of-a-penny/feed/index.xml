					<description><![CDATA[Totally incorrect and kinda naieve. Thought it was pretty common knowledge the 9/10 was purely for the psychological effect of seeing a lower number for the price. Also, You pay what you pay. Skimming a fraction of a sale is called theft. Most cards can be charged fractions. Since the practice of 9/10 is quite a bit older than credit cards.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Not really understanding this argument; you&#039;re paying for 10 gallons of gas which is $32.49, which can be charged for correctly. So you&#039;re paying the exact dollar price per gallon that&#039;s advertised. If you managed to buy 10 individual gallons separately, you might have an argument, but in that case, as Correction points out you&#039;re only being shorted by a tenth of a penny.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[If you’re comparing 9 tenths to 0. Yes they made 9 cents more. 

But you’re supposed to be comparing 3.249 to 3.25, NOT 3.24. 

So 3.249*10= 32.49 
Vs 3.250*10=32.50]]></description>

Yeah, not having pennies in AUS was nice.  I liked the $1 and $2 coins too.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[There was a similar plot in the movie Office Space.
It also made me think of how Australia has gotten rid of the penny altogether and whenever we would pump petrol at  the station, you would always make sure that it ended in 2 cents or 7 cents so it would round down to the nearest 5 cents.  If it went to 3 or 8, it rounded up.  This worked because we always paid cash, but I wonder if it applied when using a card.
Now I&#039;m wondering if the interest on my bank account when I was there did the same thing. :-/]]></description>

Interesting, I hadn&#039;t heard that before.  I could totally see that being the case, like the current EC2 pricing, at such low prices per gallon those fractions of a penny would be a decent percentage of the unit price.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The 9/10ths of a penny on gas prices is a remnant of the great depression, I thought. When gas cost 19-20 cents a gallon, that psychological 19 vs 20 made a difference.]]></description>
