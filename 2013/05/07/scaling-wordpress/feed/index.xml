					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;/2013/05/07/scaling-wordpress/#comment-4042&quot;&gt;Vernon Fowler&lt;/a&gt;.

Newer versions of MySQL default to InnoDB now instead of MyISAM.  This was long over due.

As far as bbPress and BuddyPress, use InnoDB unless you have a good and specific reason not to.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[On slide 15 you mention to &quot;Use InnoDB, unless you have a good reason not to&quot;. Should the current / next version of WordPress specify this storage engine out of the box? Should plugins that create tables also specify this storage engine?

Currently I have a mix of mostly MyISAM and InnoDB for just a few tables that were created by a plugin. Do you have any recommendations for a bbPress and BuddyPress site in relation to database storage engines?

Thanks for your time.]]></description>
