Another metric that would point to how we are doing: the time between when a vaccine shipment is received and when it is given.  Until we are over this pandemic I would be expect that to be 5 days or less.",

Given that every infection could result in death, 1 in every 200 known Utah infections have died so far, and we're experiencing over 2,000 known new cases per day, we are likely to see hundreds more Covid deaths. The vaccination part of preventing these deaths couldn't be more important. I'm with those demanding all deliberate speed including 24/7 administration of the shots. Gov-elect Cox and Director Saunders must see that it happens. Any delay whatever is unconscionable.",
