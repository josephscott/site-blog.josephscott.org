This is definitely a time for all hands on deck.  Another metric that would point to how we are doing: the time between when a vaccine shipment is received and when it is given.  Until we are over this pandemic I would be expect that to be 5 days or less.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thank you, this is worthwhile bringing to everyone&#039;s attention (and comports with my own calculations.) Given that every infection could result in death, 1 in every 200 known Utah infections have died so far, and we&#039;re experiencing over 2,000 known new cases per day, we are likely to see hundreds more Covid deaths. The vaccination part of preventing these deaths couldn&#039;t be more important. I&#039;m with those demanding all deliberate speed including 24/7 administration of the shots. Gov-elect Cox and Director Saunders must see that it happens. Any delay whatever is unconscionable.]]></description>
