For the time being, I\u0092ve kludged the date (adding the difference between the local TZ and GMT) so that WP gets the post date right.  This is ugly and I'd rather not do this . . .\n\nIt's been suggested that I use the date_created_gmt field, but I've had zero luck getting this to work.  It seems that WP doesn't recognize the passed in java.util.Date as a valid date and subsequently defaults to the current date.\n\nAny thoughts on whats going on here?  Anyone care to share some working code?\n\nHere's a snipet of what I'm doing . . .\n\n\nHashMap content = new HashMap();\n\njava.util.Date postDate;\n\nCalendar c = Calendar.getInstance();\nc.add(Calendar.Days, 7);\n\npostDate = c.getTime();\n\n// System.out.println(postDate); yeilds\n\n// snip . . .\n// title, keywords, category, description, etc.  are all populated . . .\n\ncontent.put(\"title\",title);\ncontent.put(\"mt_keywords\",keywords);\ncontent.put(\"categories\", new String[]{category});\ncontent.put(\"post_status\", \"publish\");\ncontent.put(\"description\", articlebody);\n //content.put(\"date_created_gmt\",  postDate);  // date doesn't get interpretted correctly and defaults to the current date\ncontent.put(\"dateCreated\", postDate); // date is offset by local TZ - GMT\n\nObject[] params = new Object[]{new String(\"n/a\"), user, pass, content, new Boolean(\"true\")};\n Object token;\ntry {\n  token = client.invoke(\"metaWeblog.newPost\", params);\n} catch (XmlRpcException ex) {\n  Logger.getLogger(WPDripFeederView.class.getName()).log(Level.SEVERE, null, ex);\n} catch (XmlRpcFault ex) {\n  Logger.getLogger(WPDripFeederView.class.getName()).log(Level.SEVERE, null, ex);\n}",
