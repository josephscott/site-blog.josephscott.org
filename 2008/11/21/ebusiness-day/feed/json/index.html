That said there are increasing trends like the virtual office employee that should get some recognition.  With communication getting faster and the ability to travel being pretty easy we shouldn't hesitate to talk about operating within a wide community.",

From what I saw this event was clearly targeted at two groups of people, students and larger businesses (or those who want to start them).  Nothing wrong with that and like I said, it was good to go out of my comfort zone to find out what people in other circles were seeing.\n\nMy disappointment and no mention of the whole virtual office trend was that one of the concerns brought up was being able to attract tech talent workforce to the area.  Seems at least some percentage of the virtual office workforce could be tempted to move to Utah, there by growing the local tech talent in the area.  This is especially true for Provo, which already has a city wide fiber to the home infrastructure, making high speed Internet access available to just about everyone in the city.  Sadly, there's no fiber to the home in Sandy :-(",
