I don&#039;t have any problem living in Utah and I don&#039;t even ski :-)

I can sympathize in this events efforts to focus on the local aspects of business, funding, talent, etc.  Looking locally is a pretty natural instinct for most people.  That said there are increasing trends like the virtual office employee that should get some recognition.  With communication getting faster and the ability to travel being pretty easy we shouldn&#039;t hesitate to talk about operating within a wide community.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;/2008/11/21/ebusiness-day/#comment-2480&quot;&gt;Lorelle&lt;/a&gt;.

I&#039;ve been able to find like minded folks in the more casual get events.  From what I saw this event was clearly targeted at two groups of people, students and larger businesses (or those who want to start them).  Nothing wrong with that and like I said, it was good to go out of my comfort zone to find out what people in other circles were seeing.

My disappointment and no mention of the whole virtual office trend was that one of the concerns brought up was being able to attract tech talent workforce to the area.  Seems at least some percentage of the virtual office workforce could be tempted to move to Utah, there by growing the local tech talent in the area.  This is especially true for Provo, which already has a city wide fiber to the home infrastructure, making high speed Internet access available to just about everyone in the city.  Sadly, there&#039;s no fiber to the home in Sandy :-(]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Honestly, so much of Utah&#039;s culture makes me want to LEAVE. Like you, I can work anywhere there is high speed Internet access, but the only thing keeping me here is that rent is half of what it would be if I moved. Oh yeah, and family.

If my sister moved out of state, I would have no qualms about following her, even if it were Idaho. I&#039;m THAT embarrassed by Utah right now.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[As you know, travel has been the end of my sentences for too long. As I&#039;ve lived around the world, I&#039;ve always worked hard to seek out like minds and tech geeks. I&#039;m always surprised at where I find the most enthusiasm and worldly view, often in unlikely places.

It&#039;s also an ebb and flow process. Some areas are persistently techno joy-filled, while others get it for a short period of time and then the economy, trends, fads, and economic movement of business shift and bend the enthusiasm away from the area.

There are also a lot of people who tell me repeatedly that they are alone in their community when it comes to technological proficiency and capital. Yet they hold a WordPress Meetup and people come out of the walls. :D

Thanks for the interesting perspective on your introduction to Utah tech. It&#039;s going to be interesting to watch how you handle this new community, or invest more of your time on the virtual community, which many are doing, too.]]></description>
