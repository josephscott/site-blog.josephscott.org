					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;/2008/11/20/the-constitution-of-the-united-states-article-i-section-2/#comment-2466&quot;&gt;Tom Gardner&lt;/a&gt;.

I&#039;m still not entirely clear on this.  It mentions &quot;most numerous branch of the state legislature&quot;, isn&#039;t there at least one state that doesn&#039;t have multiple branches in their legislature?  Nebraska, that&#039;s the one I was thinking of.  Since they only have one branch I guess that branch by definition is the largest :-)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&quot;and the Electors in each State shall have the Qualifications requisite for Electors of the most numerous Branch of the State Legislature&quot;

To the best of my knowledge, this is referring to the people who were elected by the populace, who then elected the Representatives (and maybe Senators) to DC.  This country started as a Republic, not a Democracy, and these &quot;Electors&quot; were just a more local version of the Electoral College, which we still use to elect the President.]]></description>
