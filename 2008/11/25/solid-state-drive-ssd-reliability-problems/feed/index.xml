					<description><![CDATA[purchased a scandisk SSD plus had it in my new cyberpower PC that is just under a month old and the SSD 240GB failed and my system can not find it. This will be my one and only SSD drive I own. I refuse to use something that fails in under a month. Waiting on scandick to get back in touch with about this.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is a common problem with Transcend Micro Solid State Drives. If you are running your Windows Operating System on one of these drives, you will get a super-fast startup time and application start time.

However, the OS crashes frequently to either the BSOD or just shuts off the computer. We have been looking into this and need to find out more to correct this problem.

					<description><![CDATA[I thought I would try a ssd. Iratic I think is the word. win xp pro, freeze certain programs freeze. The last strw is I was going to copy a program and making it an iso. using imgburn I could not do it. Fail fail fail. went to another comp and no problem. some things are good but when it just went too far and it seemed like it took parts of one printer and mixed them up and they would not print correct. reformatted. now wait &#038; see.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have a Samsung EVO 120GB SSD.  It worked perfectly for about 2 months and then I THOUGHT it died on me (just like today).  I&#039;m running Fedora Linux on it on a desktop computer as a primary drive and system.  However, I found if I swapped to a different SATA port it all started working like new again.  Go figure!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I put an OCZ 128gb SSD in my desktop as the primary drive and it ran fine for 3 months.  However, in the last month I have had numerous system crashes and drive scans continually turn up bad sectors.  In 20- years of computing I have never lost data due to a crash until now.  After this experience, and all that I have read in the last 24hrs, methinks SSD&#039;s are not yet ready for prime time...or at least not ready enough for me  I am returning this POS and going back to a tried and true HDD.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have had a 60 GB SSD in my Windows 7 machine for four months and have had to perform numerous system restores and two full reinstalls of Windows 7 Ultimate. Last night in the middle of an HP printer update, the machine froze up. Upon reboot, or should I say attempted reboot, it seems that I it no longer can find the boot manager. I am at the point where I am suspecting the SSD, and am looking to go back to HDD.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I went SSD two months ago.  I have a 180 G Cosair.  It is working great so far.  I&#039;m a gamer and have only loaded games to date.  Wow, what a difference.  Bit afraid to load critical data.  Switching back to my Segate for email, etc.  Its so fast I really want to switch everything over but will continue to test for a while.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I got my OCZ Vertex Plus 60GB - my test was simple: 

1) I took the OCZ SSD and my trusted Crucial M4 SSD
2) I installed the same OS on both (same system, same everything)
3) I tried various scenarios such as pressing reset button when system idle, pulling the power chord out, filling up ram and causing a kernel panic, etc.
4) My Crucial was just fine in all tests, the OCZ Vertex showed severe filesystem corruption, large directories simply missing, etc in all tests - including the system freeze test!

I am sending my OCZ back on Monday.]]></description>
