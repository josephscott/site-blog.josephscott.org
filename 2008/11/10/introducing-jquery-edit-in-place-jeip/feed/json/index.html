That wouldn't prevent the \"Saving...\" text from being removed though.  Have you tried this on an empty page?  Perhaps there's something else on the page that's causing the problem.\n\nIf you can pin down what's going on please contact me (http://josephscott.org/contact/).  I'm happy to fix bugs in the code.",
