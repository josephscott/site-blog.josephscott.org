					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for sharing this Joseph! Great stuff!

For anyone else who is noticing a problem when copying the code displayed on this page, you may have noticed that some of the HTML entities have been encoded. So a plain copy/paste from above doesn&#039;t work. You have to unencode them. In this script it&#039;s not all that easy to find them all.

I did find another article that has the same snippet available without that problem:

					<description><![CDATA[Hi,

I tested again and you are partially right. This case:

&quot;My site (http://josephscott.org)&quot;/

still did not work but this did:

&quot;My site (http://josephscott.org)/ period.&quot;

So I added a trailing space character to the string on line 41 and that seemed to fix the problem.

I am having trouble deciphering that regex. Can we not find a solution where line 41 looks like:

&quot;{$text}&quot;

instead of:

&quot; {$text} &quot;

thx]]></description>

Multiple people have indicated that this code is working.  Can you confirm that your copied code is the same as what I posted?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi again,

I have reconstructed the wordpress make_clickable code to try and get this to work and it still does not work(at least on a PHP4 engine).

Please see MakeItLink2.php and MakeItLink3.php which can be found in this zip:

http://pinchpile.com/makelink.zip

MakeItLink2.php is a class for making links without taking parens into consideration. This works as expected.

MakeItLink3.php is a class for taking parens into account as coded in the leaner version diff for ticket 8300. This code still does not work for(on PHP4 at least) this test case:

My site (http://josephscott.org)/

Can you test it on PHP 4/5 and get back to me? Thanks.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi,

I copied the code to my clipboard and pasted it to a PHP file. Then I removed the protected/public keywords because I have PHP4. I started testing it and it does not work for a link in parens that has no parens. The ending closing paren is included as part of the link. This is the example I was testing(hopefully it will render properly):

My site (http://josephscott.org)/

If it doesn&#039;t render properly it is this case:

(link)

Can you test this with a PHP4 version of MakeItLink? And if it works for you can you post a link to your actual class file?]]></description>

Sorry, this appears to completely my fault.  Not sure when/where, but I managed to completely botch that regex line.  I&#039;ve updated the code in the post with the correct regex line.  I tried the corrected version (minus the protected/public keywords) with PHP4 and confirmed that it works now.

My apologies for the confusion.]]></description>
