					<description><![CDATA[Hm, I guess to be counted as a virus is a minor problem compared to this one that as a blogger (if you become valuated as a spammer for whatever mysterious reasons) at an instant,
 ALL YOUR LINKS can get CUT OFF.

Guess by whom.

The G-power that can make you visible for search engines
can make you also completely UNSEEN, invisible.

When this happens to you, your traffic from search engines goes down to Zero.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Dear Google, If it happens to me again, i promise I will wipe Google off my computer. You have too much power. We users have a right to your services. You give it and you take it away. I may just call for a boycott of Google. This business of you restricting my use of your almighty search
engine is foolish on your part. all I have to do is apply to the many search services and email services on the web and you can take your foolishness elsewhere. As a matter of fact, I thaink I&#039;ll do what I&#039;ve threatened right now. Goodbye Google(!!!!!!) Doug Rosbury            hdrosbury@gmail.com
Now, no more problems from &quot;Google&quot;. ByeBye. You can&#039;t buy all the companies.]]></description>
