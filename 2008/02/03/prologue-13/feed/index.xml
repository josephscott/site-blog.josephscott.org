					<description><![CDATA[@Cole -

There&#039;s a demo site at &lt;a href=&quot;http://prologuedemo.wordpress.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://prologuedemo.wordpress.com/&lt;/a&gt;

@Daniel -

I&#039;ve had a few people point to translations, at some point I&#039;d like to get them pulled together.  I&#039;ll keep this one in mind.

As for the title, since it doesn&#039;t show up in too many places I wasn&#039;t worried about preserving words, just making sure it wasn&#039;t empty.  That said, I&#039;m not necessarily opposed to doing the extra work to preserve words/spacing, just isn&#039;t high on the list of things to get done.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Joseph,

great work! I&#039;ve done a german translation of Prologue 1.3:
http://hausmitteilungen.com/wordpress-theme-prologue-auf-deutsch/
and there is one question: I&#039;m unable to find the function which creates the titles (and the permalinks), because I would love to change it a little bit.
I think 40 chars is great for title and link, but the last word should be left intact, don&#039;t you think?

					<description><![CDATA[Nice work Joseph.

One small request, could you guys include a file change log in future releases? or maybe some sort of bug tracker?

The SVN is updating a lot and for users like myself who are tinkering with the code, it would be a big help.

Thank you in advance.]]></description>
