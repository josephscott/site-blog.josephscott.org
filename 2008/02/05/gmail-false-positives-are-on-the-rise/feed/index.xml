					<description><![CDATA[Last 2 weeks I&#039;ve got a dozen of  false positives
(good messages in spam box). Some of them were from respectful
domains.
But I was killed by spam filter today - when me friend (he also uses
gmail and we email each other frequently) has received invitation from
my googlegroup and it was marked as SPAM !!!!.
Impossible.
Something should be done - such false positives is a real shame on
gmail spam filter.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I am wondering if there is a way to say that something is NOT spam. I am getting messages with this in front:  &quot;SPAM:: message&quot;

In most cases these messages are NOT spam.

They show up in my inbox, but the subject line has SPAM:: at its onset. If I respond to emails I need to manually change the subject line. I forget sometimes...

Any ideas?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve noticed a similar thing as well lately.

But I do see a trend -- at least in my case.  The legit emails getting flagged are all from forwarded accounts, not emails addressed to the gmail address.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@Jeff -

For as long as I can remember Hotmail has had problems with spam.  That was one reason why I never used it much.  Having Gmail be better is good, but having false positives is very bad.

@Daniel -

I tried Yahoo&#039;s email service for awhile and really didn&#039;t care for it at all.

@Jim -

I&#039;m trying to incorporate checking my Gmail spam folder once a day into my routine.  Hasn&#039;t worked yet, need to leave myself a note some where.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think this is likely a strategy everyone needs to use, no matter the platform.  I&#039;ve been very careful where I put my GMail address, and use Yahoo! instead as the lowest-common-denominator garbage collector.  I&#039;ve been zero-inboxing Yahoo! for years now, and that includes checking my &quot;Bulk Mail&quot; box daily.  I pull a stray false-positive out roughly once a month or so.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Well I wouldn&#039;t blame all of it on Google.  The craftiness of the spamming community if its really a community changes every day.  My GMAIL stays pretty clean compared to hotmail which I have had for 11 years.  I think the root of the problem is when WE publish our email address everywhere, so expect the spam crafters to hit us.  Frankly google has less false positives that other services I use hotmail, yahoo, aim.com etc.  Even fighting my own spam can be a full time gig!]]></description>
