					<description><![CDATA[wheee

I figured that finally, basically went through the code and could display the status var of rss object, it says 500. Then I could finally display the error and it says limit 2s timeout, the time out of fetching the rss, and this hit me , because this rss is pretty big, so increasing to 5s fixed the problem :)

thanks Joseph to figure the problem]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[yeah , there is another option timestamp for that feed, deleted it didn&#039;t help, I will look at it tomorrow yet.

I just thought that there are WP functions which deals with caching.

I played also with code little bit, found cache_age vars or other which may be responsible for keeping the cache but there must be something else yet like you said.]]></description>

I&#039;d have to look through that chunk of code to figure out why it isn&#039;t trying to refresh the cache for that feed.  If I were to guess there might be another option that lists what feeds have been cached and where in the options table they are. If that&#039;s the case and you only deleted the cached feeds then it might think that the feed is cached, but then find nothing in the cache.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I figured that it cache in DB in wp_options table, I found my record, but before I changed url of rss to see is it actually caching it there. New record showed up, awesome.

So I removed the new record and that bad one.

Now it does not cache at all, my rss feed won&#039;t show up because fetch_rss() return false.

I wonder why it doesn&#039;t want to cache new feeds

Any ideas

I know that this is not right place to ask about that but you may know the solution.

Thanks]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[very interesting !

I replaced the url of the rss from the same user picasa account and this WP took it.

Caching old rss maybe possible, but have no idea how to clear it.

Thanks for help and responds.]]></description>

Since you are using fetch_rss() did you check to see if it was a using a cached copy of the feed? If it cached the feed while having libxml2 problems then it might be still using it.]]></description>
