Then I could finally display the error and it says limit 2s timeout, the time out of fetching the rss, and this hit me , because this rss is pretty big, so increasing to 5s fixed the problem :)\n\nthanks Joseph to figure the problem",

If I were to guess there might be another option that lists what feeds have been cached and where in the options table they are. If that's the case and you only deleted the cached feeds then it might think that the feed is cached, but then find nothing in the cache.",
