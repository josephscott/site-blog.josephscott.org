It seems unlikely (although certainly not impossible) that a major political party would allow, support and endorse a candidate that didn't meet those requirements.",

            "content_html": "I am pleased to find this website which has been so timely posted. The Congess is getting ready to do the review and evaluation for certification of the elctoral votes cast on December 15, 2008, on January 5, 2009 or January 6, 2009 depending on which website you read. I have tried to find a list of all the electors but to no avail. I amvery concerned that it is quite possible, and even very likely that some elector may be holders of offices of trust or profit under the United States in violation of the Constitution, Article II Section 1 pargraphs 1-2. Illegal electoral votes should not be certified!!!!\n\nIn addition to the foregoing comments, I would like to point out that all the information that appeared in the press regarding the voting of the electors indicated that they had assembled \"to do their duty\". This is misinformation, as rules vary from state to state, and not all electors are bound to vote for the popular choice of the state although they usually do. There was in fact no consideration given to any of the issues surrounding Obama as Constutionally eligible to serve, or any discussion of the best inteest of the United States of America. This electoral system if it functions properly has the potential insist that everything be done exactly correct for a candidate to be able to recieve a given electoral vote. I indeed has the potential to act as a check on the rest of the electoral process to see that the people get a President that has been elected in acord with the provisions of the U.S. Constitution!!!!",
