That&#039;s an odd error, make sure that your WordPress install is not missing any files.  Also go through the regular debug checks, disable all of your plugins and see if the problem still happens.  Switch to the default WordPress theme and see if it still happens.  Either of those (plugins and themes) could cause problems, so best to rule them out quickly.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m new to wordpress and i&#039;m running on 2.7.I&#039;ve got the weirdest thing that when i make changes to the settings/writing page, specifically to enable xml-rpc, and click &quot;save changes&quot; I get the following message:

Forbidden
You don&#039;t have permission to access /wp-admin/options.php on this server.

Additionally, a 404 Not Found error was encountered while trying to use an ErrorDocument to handle the request.
Apache/1.3.41 Server at worship.bergtee.co.za Port 80

Please Help! Thanks, Louw]]></description>

Ah, I should have suggested disabling plugins earlier in trying to track down the problem.  Thanks for following up on that.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m facing the same problem as Chris L above. The tags are stripped when uploading and it is a real pain fixing the same.

WLW is one of the best desktop publishing apps out there and it is irritating that WordPress 2.7 broke it.

2.6.5 works perfectly with WLW.]]></description>

Did you upgrade anything else at the same time as WordPress?  I believe that the new versions of libxml2 have introduces bugs that may cause problems.]]></description>
