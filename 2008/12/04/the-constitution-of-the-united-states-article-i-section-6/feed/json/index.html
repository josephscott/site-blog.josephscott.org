The triggering event for disqualification in the text isn't the actual dollar amount to be paid after taking the position, but the fact that an increase took place at all.\n\nIn principle I'd be fine with a Constitutional Amendment that changed the wording so that they'd be required to take the original salary.",

I didn't realize that the President could increase their salaries by simply signing an executive order.  I wonder if this has ever been used strategically.  Say that in the next Presidential election Obama looses and Republican is elected, then the day before the new President is sworn he signs an executive order raising the salary of all Congressionally approved positions.  He would then trigger this clause for any and all Senators and Representatives.\n\nIf there weren't a precedent for this already (not once, but twice), then I'd tend to agree with Judicial Watch.  The Constitution doesn't say anything about being required to take the original salary in order to take the position, it expressly forbids it taking the position at all under these circumstances.  But given that this situation has been side stepped before I'm inclined to allow the side stepping in this case too.\n\nThe right thing to do though would be to amend the Constitution to make it possible under a certain set of circumstances, like requiring them to take the original salary.",
