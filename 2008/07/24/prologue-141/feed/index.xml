					<description><![CDATA[Is there a place to add suggestions?  I know the theme is supposed to be lightweight, but it&#039;s growing in use and scale. Iwould move to see an option to display a title for each post (perhaps some code that is commented out).

But it&#039;s still a brilliant theme.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[hi Joseph,

It would be nice if you could help fix this gravatar problem mentioned in http://wordpress.org/support/topic/174995 and also upgrade prologue to exploit new facilities available with WP 2.7 (like comment threading)

thanks]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m not sure if this theme bears such functionality, but is there any way to use it on an integrated phpbb3-WP platform. This platform basically assigns phpbb users a WP account, and thus they can post to the blog. This theme would be perfect as it already features avatar integration and such. Any input would be appreciated.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Joseph,

I fixed the problem on my end. I wanted to update you. Turns out the mistake was in the URL I am embarrassed to say. I installed a hplugin in WPMU that allows you to create blog defaults. I just noticed that this plugin is appending blog/ in the permalink of the blog I created and activated Prologue.

In my opinion nothing is wrong with your theme. I&#039;ll post this to your blog in that it may help others. Thanks for Prologue it is a THEME which RULES !

@Tapelog how did you hook up the podcasting plugin into this thats RAD]]></description>
