I&#039;d never heard of &quot;smtp.gmail.com&quot; until messages began intruding to advise me the the same rejected my outgoing mail.

Are they in any way related to Cavalier who recently took over my slow, but affordable former provider?

The communication breakdown they caused me was devastating and expensive. I am beginning to to wish for the return of the &quot;penny postcard&quot;.]]></description>
