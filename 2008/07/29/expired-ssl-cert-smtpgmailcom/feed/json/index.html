I'd never heard of \"smtp.gmail.com\" until messages began intruding to advise me the the same rejected my outgoing mail.  I have been well served by IncrediMail--which I updated and paid for. Who is/are the \"smpt....\"? Are they in any way related to Cavalier who recently took over my slow, but affordable former provider?  I ask because at the time of the takeover they hijacked my e-mail and I had no service at all for six weeks. They had promised faster, improved, more efficient service with a g-mail account. It didn't materialize.  After six weeks of \"negotiations\" I got my IncrediMail restored and had to hit the delete key over three-thousand times to clean up the six week mess!  The communication breakdown they caused me was devastating and expensive. I am beginning to to wish for the return of the \"penny postcard\".",
