					<description><![CDATA[I am really fascinated by  prologue theme and WP Contact Manager but these seem to be themes to add the ability to manage contacts by turning wordpress into a contact manager

what i would really like is something like the original prologue and a contact manager for my blog i.e. in the admin area so I could manage my contacts there and have a central repository with all the web goodness (I could even auth them to have prialedges on my blog and use the webs goodness for maps etc within the admin area...)

regards

					<description><![CDATA[@Jacob Santos -

I&#039;ve just been paranoid and make regular backups of the code and database, at least once a day.

@Mark Jensen -

I don&#039;t have any affiliation with DiSo, other than I think there&#039;s a lot of potential in distributed social networking features.  And WordPress is in a good place to experiment with those ideas.  I really need to get some my ideas on the subject out in a blog post.

@Lloyd Budd -

Thanks, you too!  Congrats on the new arrival as well.  Parenthood, it&#039;s a trip.  :-)

Yeah, the Twitter thing is still goofy, and I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve found a happy medium on how to mix it with my blog.  As for the link posts, well, at least there&#039;s some commentary in there.  That and I didn&#039;t feel like breaking them out into a different area.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s been an absolute pleasure working with you, and I&#039;m looking forward to many more years working together!

To celebrate is it time for a favicon? ;-)

Tease: 1,000 posts minus Links (and twitter) re-posts? ;-)

					<description><![CDATA[Congrats :)

Just one question; how are you affiliated with DiSo? Is it a part of Automattic (and thus interesting for BuddyPress as well) or do you have something to do with it? It looks interesting!

					<description><![CDATA[Yeah, I remember 2004 and starting with version 1.0. Unfortunately, or was it fortunate, but anyway, I lost all my stuff upgrading from 1.0 to a 1.2 or 1.5. I was just all like, you know, all of the stuff I wrote wasn&#039;t all that good, lets just restart this whole process and make it not suck.

It&#039;s been downhill ever since, my blog I mean, WordPress has actually been sucking less since version 2.2, when I finally stopped looking for alternatives.

I actually started my blog to learn how to write better, I didn&#039;t learn about the whole &quot;blog&quot; thing until a few years later.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@Laura Moncur -

Guess I forgot to mention the move from California to Utah that took place during my first year at Automattic.

@Jeremy Zawodny -

Thanks.  It&#039;s hard to believe a whole year has gone by already.]]></description>
