However, GAE is based on Django 0.96, and it should not be that difficult to move your application to another CC such as EC2 or to your own server.\n\nAs @Deane stated, you need to build an abstraction layer between the GAE Model and whatever backend database you want to use.",

Want to take your app off of GAE and move it to your own dedicated servers?  Fine, re-write your app then because you'll no longer have any of the GAE code/libraries/services.\n\nI should point out that I still think GAE is very cool, but just like with Amazon's services, it isn't with out drawbacks.  No solution is perfect, they are all trade offs.  What's important is that you are able to make an informed decision by knowing what the trade offs are.
