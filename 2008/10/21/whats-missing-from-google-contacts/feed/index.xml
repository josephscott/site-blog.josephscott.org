					<description><![CDATA[Joseph,

Thank you for this excellent blog article.

I found your blog when googling &quot;FrameMaker&quot; &quot;Subversion&quot; (which I have not finished reading). I have been using Gmail Contacts more and more and find it very good, but limiting in some of the ways you describe here. Some I don&#039;t use anyway, so those issues have not bothered me, like the Skype and photos.

Back to reading the &quot;Subversion Success&quot;. )
