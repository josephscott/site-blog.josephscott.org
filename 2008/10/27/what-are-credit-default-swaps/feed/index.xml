Just watching this makes me shiver as an american indeed it was one of the reasons i moved to japan as there most decisions are much more controlled and corruptness creeps less for better or worse one might argue.

credit is just virtual numbers and most politicians play with millions and billions as if our country is a monopoly game - one bet that shaked the country? ... shame on them]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Ron Paul 2012. :P

Anyway, instead, why not ditch flat currency and head back to sound currency (currency that&#039;s backed by and exchangeable for gold or silver). Almost every single politician doesn&#039;t understand how the markets and the economy works. Why are we still trusting them? (it could be because no one knows either...) The whole system is based on credit, and credit is... what?

Ah, oh well. I&#039;m moving to Australia or Japan (which one depends on whether or not the world holds economically).]]></description>
