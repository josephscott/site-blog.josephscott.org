					<description><![CDATA[That is a pretty amazing number of blogs. So this is WP.com that we are talking about? I wonder how many blogs there are out there using word press on their server by choice. I would think that it&#039;s even more then 4-5 million and would be interesting to know how many there actually are.

Also why did you retire the blog?

Thanks,

Chris...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Joseph, after reading your About, given you know a lot about WP, I realize that we both have a similar interest.

I&#039;m going to ask, if possible, I could host a guest article or two from your experiences with MySQL and PostgreSQL, on my site.

I&#039;m specifically interested in knowing your experiences with them considering they are open source (MySQL considered probably the most popular) and how well you&#039;d say they get the job done. Any pros, cons and the likes would be appreciated.]]></description>
