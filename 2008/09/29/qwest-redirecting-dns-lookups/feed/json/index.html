We even tried to hard-code all the DNS entires and that didn't help us at all.  I went ahead with the opt-out and after about 3 minutes I lost all internet connection, so I rebooted the router/modem and when it came back up I was finally able to access our internal network resources over the VPN without having to use the IP addresses to gain access.  The strangest thing with this experience was that the VPN used to work just fine, but then all of a sudden I wasn't able to get any internal work address to resove to anything but a qwest ip address (63.226.162.129).\n\nThanks again,\n\nMatt",
