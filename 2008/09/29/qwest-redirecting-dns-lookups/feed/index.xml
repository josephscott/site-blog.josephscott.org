					<description><![CDATA[Thank you for this. I just started to experience very slow page lookup. Very odd because I have the Moto 3347 modem set for opendns.  I run scutil --dns and get this:  Mac OS X 10.5 setup

DNS configuration

resolver #1
  nameserver[0] : 208.67.222.222
  nameserver[1] : 208.67.220.220
  nameserver[2] : 205.171.3.26
  nameserver[3] : 205.171.2.26

4 dns servers? Really. I opted out of this, lets see what happens.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks a lot for this post.  I have been experiencing a lot of issues with the VPN at work in the past few weeks because of strange DNS issues.  We even tried to hard-code all the DNS entires and that didn&#039;t help us at all.  I went ahead with the opt-out and after about 3 minutes I lost all internet connection, so I rebooted the router/modem and when it came back up I was finally able to access our internal network resources over the VPN without having to use the IP addresses to gain access.  The strangest thing with this experience was that the VPN used to work just fine, but then all of a sudden I wasn&#039;t able to get any internal work address to resove to anything but a qwest ip address (63.226.162.129).

Thanks again,

Matt]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Here in Missouri, we have a choice between 2 major ISPs that offer DSL service. I decied to gowith Centurytel, after a very simialr service issue with SBCGlobal.
They weren&#039;t redirecting us or anyting like that. But they were doing some shady practices and then providing the infamous &quot;opt-out&quot; when we never opted in to begin with.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for this. This has caused many problems with users in my office and not being able to connect to Outlook while connected to the VPN. We&#039;ve had 2 people test it so far and so far so good. Funny thing is that none of these users got an e-mail from Qwest notifying them of this. Anyway, thanks again. I think this may have resolved our problem. Freakin Qwest!!!]]></description>
