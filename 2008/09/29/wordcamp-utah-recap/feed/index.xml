					<description><![CDATA[I loved the event. It was absolutely worth the drive down from Boise.

A couple of things:

1. Some higher quality speakers would be good. Or at least more preparation on their part. Both Matt&#039;s and Cameron&#039;s were great, but a few of the others were lacking (I thought the WP as a CMS talk made it sound far more difficult than it actually is).

2. Get the presenters to practice more. I am not sure how exactly to do that since they are volunteering their time, but more practice would have made several of the presentations a lot better.

3. Multiple tracks would be great. There were some people there just getting into blogging mixed with some advanced users, so multiple tracks would be nice.

I loved the food and the people. Thanks to all the sponsors, speakers, and volunteers who made such a great event possible!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I thought it went amazingly well! Between this and the Open Source Conference, Utah is finally starting to feel like a legitimate part of the tech world.

The schedule (panels / breaks / lunch) worked fine for me.

I would have liked some more advanced presentations, which probably would require a separate track. Maybe two tracks next time? Or two days?

Matt Mullenweg&#039;s talk was great, and Cameron Moll was amazing - I learned a ton about design.

Thanks again Joseph and everyone for making this happen!]]></description>
