Or at least more preparation on their part. Both Matt's and Cameron's were great, but a few of the others were lacking (I thought the WP as a CMS talk made it sound far more difficult than it actually is).\n\n2. Get the presenters to practice more. I am not sure how exactly to do that since they are volunteering their time, but more practice would have made several of the presentations a lot better.\n\n3. Multiple tracks would be great. There were some people there just getting into blogging mixed with some advanced users, so multiple tracks would be nice.\n\nI loved the food and the people. Thanks to all the sponsors, speakers, and volunteers who made such a great event possible!",
