					<description><![CDATA[Use compete.com it will give you more accurate results for comparison purposes. It can&#039;t count all the hits or visits but it is a pretty accurate tool.

					<description><![CDATA[It does worth it for websites under 10,000. Under that number, then its more accurate. I did install the Alexa toolbar and one of my site rank went from 700,000 to 150,000, So I can say that its a useless tool.

Compete and Quantcast are more accurate, if you are looking for just U.S traffic.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I agree with all of you, Alexa is not an accurate way to measure the traffic rank of a site.

Since, Alexa data is collected using Alexa&#039;s toolbar, Alexa has a bias for sites related with I.T. (since most IT people uses their bar. Usually a doctor or a lawyer does not take care about alexa numbers). And also have the other issue about webmaster visiting their own sites.

 I think the best way to measure traffic ranks on a site is using the unique visitor numbers (not even hits nor visitors). A site is popular is a lot of people visit it, not if a reduced amount of people visit it a lot of times.

Well, these are my 2 cents. Thanks for allow me to post in your blog.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Joseph, you&#039;re right - Alexa is not really showing accurate numbers. Somewhere I&#039;ve read that Alexa stats are based on Alexa Toolbar reports. I wanted to find out and installed the Toolbar. Instantly, all of my sites went up - as I&#039;m causing disproportionate traffic on them while checking, posting &#038; maintaining.

I&#039;d say it depends very much on the topic of a site and it&#039;s geographic location - as Alexa is not really well-known in some parts of the world resp. readers of non-internet blog topics.

In spite of its impreciseness it may harm webmasters in monetizing their sites, as advertisers use Alexa Stats for checking the popularity of publishers.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@Matt -

Good point, especially for my site.  This brings up the question then, where&#039;s the cut off for useful numbers?  Is anything beyond the top 100 (or 500) highly suspect?

@Stefin -

Which is one of the reasons why I posted this.  Over reliance on Alexa for &quot;regular&quot; sites is a bit scary.

@Lavi -

I compared it with ma.tt because I knew that site gets a lot more traffic than I do, but wasn&#039;t miles and miles ahead of me (like any of the sites in the top 500).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Joseph,

My experience with Alexa is a bit different.
I use it together with other analytic tools, and get a pretty accurate reading for a site with about 8000 uniques per day.

See comparison:
http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details/simania.co.il?site0=simania.co.il&#038;site1=steimatzky.co.il&#038;site2=booknetshop.co.il&#038;site3=bookme.co.il&#038;y=r&#038;z=3&#038;h=400&#038;w=700&#038;c=1&#038;u%5B%5D=simania.co.il&#038;u%5B%5D=steimatzky.co.il&#038;u%5B%5D=booknetshop.co.il&#038;u%5B%5D=bookme.co.il&#038;x=2008-06-12T06%3A50%3A09.000Z&#038;check=www.alexa.com&#038;signature=tIl1fDcXLXWl1Mzt5EQxjn9KjOE%3D&#038;range=3m&#038;size=Large

Alexa does not have accurate results for ma.tt for some reason.
For many other sites it gives a good estimate for comparison.
Like any other pole it should not be taken too seriously but trends can be extracted from it.
