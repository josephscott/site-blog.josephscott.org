					<description><![CDATA[@Laura-

There are definitely some blogs that do post useful/interesting stuff from time to time but I don&#039;t subscribe to for one reason or another.  I&#039;ll do that same thing you mentioned and just rely on others to link to the really interesting posts on those blogs.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I usually use the lack of information trail as an excuse to delete the blog from my RSS feed. There are SO many blogs out there. If a weblog can&#039;t provide me with a link to the original concept, then there is no point reading them anymore.

If they are reporting on something unique and it turns out to be true, someone else will link to them and I&#039;ll see it eventually.

If they can&#039;t be bothered with providing sources, then they don&#039;t deserve my limited time.]]></description>
