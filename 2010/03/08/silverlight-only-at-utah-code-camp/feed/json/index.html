Just a few weeks before I had to build a new website and I had something free 6 hours in which to do it (volunteering my time, of course).  I was also giving a presentation on Silverlight and did the new website as my demo project. \n\nWhile I got plenty of complaints, NOBODY ELSE OFFERED TO HELP! I ended up taking a day off work (another 8-12 hours volunteered) to create an HTML version to stop the complaining from people that were more ideologically motivated than anything else.  The HTML version wasn't half as nice or functional and took considerably more effort to build. \n\nAs this was only a stopgap solution to begin with I've since re-written the site (donating roughly 40+ hours this time).  \n\nNext time perhaps you'll offer assistance rather than putting up a blog post about how I am!\n\nThx!",
