If time was a concern why not just fix the Community Server install instead of starting over from scratch?  As I recall that version of the site didn&#039;t require a plugin in order to just view the site.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I hope you&#039;re having a great time at my expense! :)

Look, our previous website was a Community Server site that was hacked and ruined! Just a few weeks before I had to build a new website and I had something free 6 hours in which to do it (volunteering my time, of course).  I was also giving a presentation on Silverlight and did the new website as my demo project. 

While I got plenty of complaints, NOBODY ELSE OFFERED TO HELP! I ended up taking a day off work (another 8-12 hours volunteered) to create an HTML version to stop the complaining from people that were more ideologically motivated than anything else.  The HTML version wasn&#039;t half as nice or functional and took considerably more effort to build. 

As this was only a stopgap solution to begin with I&#039;ve since re-written the site (donating roughly 40+ hours this time).  

Next time perhaps you&#039;ll offer assistance rather than putting up a blog post about how I am!

Thx!]]></description>

For a long time nothing, I just got a response the other day saying they created a separate HTML only version of the site.  There&#039;s now a &quot;Click here to use HTML Only Version.&quot; link on the site.  Rather sad.]]></description>

It&#039;s nice that they have a plugin for Linux users, but that doesn&#039;t change the core problem with building an entire site that is dependent on a plugin.]]></description>
