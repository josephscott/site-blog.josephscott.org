					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;/2010/03/30/social-media-end-game/#comment-3364&quot;&gt;Brie&lt;/a&gt;.

I&#039;ve found Twitter to be virtually useless to cary on conversations.  If I find something in Twitter that I&#039;d like to talk about I point people to some other medium that actually works for conversations (email, IRC, blog, etc.).  One area that I think Twitter really shines is discovery.  Being able to search tweets helps find out what people are saying.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Word.

It takes all kinds but I&#039;m wary of these &quot;social media maven&quot; types. I still use Twitter, for example, to engage in real conversation with real people, without selling myself or my blog.

I agree that intent plays a big part of this, but it&#039;s also very hard to measure.  I suppose this is a case of where actions speak louder than words.]]></description>

Perhaps it should be likened to the telephone.  It&#039;s communications tool, but shouldn&#039;t be used to annoy your customers at home ever 3.2 minutes.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I recently heard a great quote in regards to how to find promising authors in a class of writers. It went something like:

&lt;blockquote&gt; &quot;If you ask them why they want to be writers and they say &#039;because I&#039;ve got a great story to tell&#039; they probably won&#039;t make very good authors. If you ask them and they say &#039;because I love language and the different ways I can make it fit together&#039; they&#039;ll make a good author&quot;.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I feel much the same about &quot;social media&quot; and intent. If you ask the person why they want to create social media and the response is &quot;because I want to be famous/make sales/control the conversation&quot; they might be successful but not remarkable. It&#039;s the people that say they want to create social media because they &quot;love how it works&quot; that have the potential for creating amazing experiences worthy of referring others to.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Amen!
Whenever my friends and family come to me wanting to use social media to grow and improve their business I tell them 2 things.
1) It&#039;s a chance to actually listen to their customers and build a relationship.
2) Don&#039;t use it to just push content to people.]]></description>
