If I find something in Twitter that I'd like to talk about I point people to some other medium that actually works for conversations (email, IRC, blog, etc.).  One area that I think Twitter really shines is discovery.  Being able to search tweets helps find out what people are saying.",

If you ask them and they say 'because I love language and the different ways I can make it fit together' they'll make a good author\".</blockquote>\n\nI feel much the same about \"social media\" and intent. If you ask the person why they want to create social media and the response is \"because I want to be famous/make sales/control the conversation\" they might be successful but not remarkable. It's the people that say they want to create social media because they \"love how it works\" that have the potential for creating amazing experiences worthy of referring others to.",
