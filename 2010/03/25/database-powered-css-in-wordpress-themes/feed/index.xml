					<description><![CDATA[What about cache? I&#039;m a performance maniac and It would be great do something like this: 

1. Generate the CSS code dynamically
2. Cache it
3. Then a check: Were the options updated? Yes: update cache. No: Forget it and use the cached on.

In my mind this would lower the cpu load because it&#039;s just an &quot;if&quot; check. Do you think this approach is good? Could it work?]]></description>

I finally got it to work. Looks like you may have forgotten to add this in your functions.php file:
add_action( &#039;parse_request&#039;, &#039;my_custom_wp_request&#039; );

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Joseph, great post.
However, having a little trouble getting it to work.
I&#039;m using the options framework plugin by Devin at http://wptheming.com/options-framework-plugin/#comments.
I&#039;ve tried all three techniques you mention but not having any success with any of them, obviously doing something wrong...

I&#039;d really like to get the third method to work as it provides the flexibility I&#039;m looking for.

So, adding  to my header file just above the wp_head.

&#060;link rel=&#039;stylesheet&#039; type=&#039;text/css&#039; href=&#034;/?my-custom-content=css&quot; /&#062;

Then adding this to functions.php.: 

function my_custom_wp_request( $wp ) {
    if (
        !empty( $_GET[&#039;my-custom-content&#039;] )
        &#038;&#038; $_GET[&#039;my-custom-content&#039;] == &#039;css&#039;
    ) {
        # get theme options
        header( &#039;Content-Type: text/css&#039; );
        require dirname( __FILE__ ) . &#039;/custom-css.php&#039;;
        exit;
    }
}

Finally adding this to: custom-css.php


body {
    background-color: 
}


of_get_option[&#039;example_background&#039;] it taken from the option theme which is from http://wptheming.com/options-framework-plugin/#comments. where of_get_option($id,$default); is returned from the options.php file.
I have that all set up and working, just trying to get it all into a styles sheet for greater flexibility.

Any suggestion would be much appreciated. 
Cheers
Chris]]></description>
