His daughter, Mary Irene is my grandmother.  As a child I was always fascinated watching him strike wooden matches and put them out in his mouth.  Though I was very young at the time (4), I actually remember watching the program when it aired.  What a surprise to connect with family in much the same manner as I too was just looking around the Internet in search of family info.\nGod bless,  King Williams (son of Harvey A. Williams)",

As a child I remember sitting and listening to his stories about the Lincoln assassination and about his adventures at sea (he almost drowned) and about the Indian teepees he saw. He was very interesting. If you remember on the show they gave him a can of Prince Albert chewing tobacco. THAT was his most prized possesion! He didn't care about the money, the celebrities etc. Just that tabacco!!\nSharon",
