					<description><![CDATA[Just real quickly I want to say that the treatment is used consistently through Michigan.

The additional intersections may not cause the delay you might expect because they are all two phase intersections so they can be timed better together.

Every time you are waiting at this intersection pay attention to which vehicles are taking up a lot of time without a lot of vehicles going through the intersection. When the lefts are redirected all that poorly used time can be given to the much more efficient through movements. Just some quick thoughts I wanted to throw out for consideration.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Is this a unique intersection design or there are existing ones in US cause I think I&#039;ve never seen that idea before?

No matter how good solution is, you should be lucky that your public services do like what is done on site you linked (especially if timeline is true), there is no way that something like that we can see here, ever.]]></description>

How many people will just cut through the shopping center parking lot.  A left turn BEFORE the intersection seems smarter to me than a &quot;thrUturn&quot;, no matter how clever your marketing...]]></description>

Yeah, hard to get over the feeling that this will be more work.

Now:

- Turn left at the intersection

After:

- Go past the intersection you want to turn left at
- Wait for another intersection light
- Make a u-turn, putting you at the back of the line to get back to the intersection you just drove through
- Make a right onto the street you wanted to turn left onto

Unless you are coming from the east, in which case you need to make a right, and follow a different set of steps.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Interesting comment, Joseph. Traffic is so interesting to me.

I&#039;m honestly not sure how excited I will be to go &quot;through&quot; the intersection to do a u-turn, then a right turn. Feels like a lot of rig-a-ma-roll to me. I&#039;m guessing this will actually encourage people to seek alternate routes in the long-run ;)

I think there should be more rotarys, myself, but I lived in (and loved driving in) Boston... MORE ROTARYS!]]></description>
