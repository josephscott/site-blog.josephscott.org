If it took 10 minutes for the site to load each page on a 20Mbps fiber connection would you use it?  No.  That is why I said, the problem is when people testing the site get into the realm of \"good enough\".  Obviously that isn't the only goal for the site, it is \"a goal\", but not \"the only goal\".  Unfortunately this often translates into simply having no performance goals.\n\nThe IE6 example, well, hey, no one likes supporting IE6 :-)  However simply saying that throwing out 15% of your users is alright is insufficient data to come even close to making a decision. On WordPress.com for instance - http://en.wordpress.com/stats/traffic/ http://www.quantcast.com/p-18-mFEk4J448M we average 65million page views a day, 15% of that is 9 million page views a day.  Deciding to ignore all those users will result in a huge increase in support requests.  It still might be worth it, but looking at just the percentage can be very mis-leading if the numbers are very high.  And that doesn't even touch the issue of individual attributes of those users.  What if that 15% make up 90% of your most critical users (by revenue, target market, etc.)?\n\nI'm all for throwing IE6 under a bus, it just turns out to be a harder decision than most web devs would like.\n\nI want to be clear that I agree 100% that performance is not the only issue, but it should included in the list of issues.  In the context of the beta-newsroom.lds.org, just turn on HTTP compression support to start with, that would have a large impact and require zero code changes to the site.  Same for HTTP caching headers.  If it takes more than 5 minutes to enable compression for the site then \"you're doing it wrong\"(TM)  :-)\n\nI look forward to seeing an iteration of the site with improved performance.  I'm happy to offer pointers on techniques for improving performance.",

Something as simple as: under conditions X we expect the page load time to be under Y 95% of the time.  Then test for that.

Quantcast puts your monthly visits ( http://www.quantcast.com/newsroom.lds.org ) to newsroom.lds.org at around 150K per month (obviously direct measurement would give a more accurate number, but this works for a ball park).  If we take that as page views, 150,000 pv/mo x 600k = 90GB per month.  Cutting that in half is a good thing not just for clients, but for network infrastructure as well (for a variety of reasons it isn't actually half, but that's the ball park), giving you room to serve more clients with few resources.  And we haven't even touched on peak load issues.  Spending less tithing dollars to accomplish the same task with better performance is a good thing :-)\n\nYou mentioned General Conference being a test for the site, I just ran webpagetest.org against the site again and the page weight is now over 700KB - http://www.webpagetest.org/result/101004_6VEY/ - so compression would make an even bigger difference.  That said, the number of HTTP requests was smaller, so the page actually loads faster now.  Still no compression support though, which is sad.\n\nI'm happy to chat more about this ( contact form - http://josephscott.org/contact/ ).",
