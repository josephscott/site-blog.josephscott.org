I&#039;ve seen this more and more recently and it worries me how much it affects sites when you add new code and styles.

Like John has said above - the caching is insanely aggressive to the point where there is no simple way to refresh the cache.

As a developer - it isn&#039;t the issue of ME not seeing the updates properly, I know they should be there. But how many of my regular visitors are going to see a mangled mess on the homepage?

Eugh!]]></description>

95% of users probably never copy an address from the address bar.
I&#039;m not convinced that is a great argument for removing the address bar.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I personally don&#039;t think this as such a big issue, thinking from chrome&#039;s point of view. It makes the address bar looks simpler removing the http:// which always is there. I am quite sure that more than 95% of common users won&#039;t have any issues with this. But yes Chrome should add this into the personalization options giving more control to an advanced user like you.]]></description>

&lt;p&gt;Yeah, I&#039;d still rather just be able to copy it correctly from the URL field instead of having a separate UI item just for coping the host name.&lt;/p&gt;

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Hi Joseph,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thought I&#039;d point you to a Chrome extension I just released, which resolved exactly this issue. It&#039;s called &quot;HostCopy&quot;, and will copy to clipboard the &lt;em&gt;hostname only&lt;/em&gt; of the page you&#039;re currently browsing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can install the extension here:
https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ebnjnkfienhcidbgmifkjkkidheihcpj&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or read more about it here:
http://chrisiona.com/hostcopy/&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you like it, please feel free to advocate it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks.&lt;/p&gt;

I haven&#039;t run into the caching issue you&#039;ve described yet.  While I use Chrome as my main browser, I still prefer Firefox + Firebug for debugging sites.  I find the URL thing irritating because it breaks something so simple and fundamental as copy and paste.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Here is my problem with Chrome, I switched to Chrome full time about a year ago when FireFox decided it wanted to take a performance nosedive. FireFox was having BIG issues for me (like crashing multiple times per day). Chrome hasn&#039;t had any big issues, but several of these little issues that are starting to add up to the point where I&#039;m wondering if a switch back to FireFox may be in order.

My biggest issue with Chrome these days is the way it caches pages. I&#039;m unable to do a shift+F5 to get a complete refresh. I have to physically go and delete the cache which is several extra steps. And, when you are tweaking the CSS in a theme, that can take several attempts before it&#039;s ready to go. Each time I have to delete the cache, Chrome dies a little more.]]></description>

For a regular HTTPS site Chrome now shows a green lock and green text https (the :// are there, but are not green).

I preferred when the background color for the entire URL field changed color.  This made it easy to tell at glance what was going on.]]></description>
