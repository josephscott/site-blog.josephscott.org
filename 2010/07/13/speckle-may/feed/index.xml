Ah, so their tickets are still $1.50 for the most part -- just not on weekend evenings. Good to know :)  The kids and I have been there several times. Last time I went though, I came with just enough cash for three $1.50 tickets, and ended up $1.50 short. Not as much fun.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[There&#039;s a super cool theater in PG that gets the movies a few weeks after they&#039;ve come out.  They have stadium seating &#038; are a bit nicer than the dollar theaters (that now charge $2 per ticket, iirc) and they only charge $3 per ticket. Snacks are super cheap too. If it&#039;d be worth the extra $ and the drive to you guys, I&#039;ll let you know when it gets there.]]></description>
