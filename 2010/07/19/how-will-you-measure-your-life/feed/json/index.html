That's a tough one, I think by nature it is extra hard to be humble in HS.  Looking back on the list of silly/foolish/mean things I did during HS there is plenty of room for improvement.  While I'll still have tons of room for improvement looking back at today in another 20 years, hopefully it is more refinement and less whole sale replacement of foolish actions/attitudes :-)",
