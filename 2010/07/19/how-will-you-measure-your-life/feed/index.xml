					<description><![CDATA[Hello Joseph (Joey).

I agree with that.  There is always room for improvement as we should always be striving to better ourselves and those around us :).

It is interesting to keep in contact with those that graduated from that tiny High School.  Many seem to be doing good and I keep contact with several (still not sure what happened to Ricky :)).

FYI: I have a RSS feed to this site so I always read what you write :D.]]></description>

Hey Shawn!

Humble in High School?  That&#039;s a tough one, I think by nature it is extra hard to be humble in HS.  Looking back on the list of silly/foolish/mean things I did during HS there is plenty of room for improvement.  While I&#039;ll still have tons of room for improvement looking back at today in another 20 years, hopefully it is more refinement and less whole sale replacement of foolish actions/attitudes :-)]]></description>
