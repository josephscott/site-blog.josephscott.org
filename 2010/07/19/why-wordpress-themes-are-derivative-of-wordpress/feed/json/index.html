If you want to build a single binary (using hiphop for example) you'll need to compile WordPress + your theme + all your plugins in order to produce a single, functional application.  As Mark mentioned, themes aren't something that simply run on top of WordPress, they join together to form a single application.  This goes beyond just calling functions in separate libraries, theme and plugin code completely co-mingle with WordPress core to produce your site.\n\nThere's simply no similarity to this in Windows, for print drivers from HP or applications like Firefox.\n\nFor applications that want to speak to WordPress there are APIs like XML-RPC, AtomPub, and RSS.  Applications that make use of those APIs do not fit into the example I gave above, they are separate from WordPress and don't combine in the way that themes and plugins do to actually become a single application.",
