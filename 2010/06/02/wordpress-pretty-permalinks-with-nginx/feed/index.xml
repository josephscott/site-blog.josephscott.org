					<description><![CDATA[Mmh I know... it&#039;s been over a decade ago when this must-use plugin snippet was first launched... since then, I&#039;ve been religiously copying it to all my websites running WP over nginx.

After all these years, I wonder if the underlying issue has been &#039;fixed&#039; by Automattic at the WP core level? In other words — is this &#039;pretty permalinks&#039; workaround for nginx still necessary, on contemporary (uh, 2021) versions of WP/nginx?

I&#039;m just curious — leaving the must-use plugin around seems not to have any harmful effect, so, unless told otherwise, I&#039;ll keep it there...]]></description>

Changing the Nginx config won&#039;t impact this.  Best you could hope for was to get an update in WordPress that would make this an option.  Outside of that you&#039;ll need to stick with the simple plugin.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Awesome, thanks a ton for this. I know this is an old post and all, but is there any way to implement this directly into the vhost config with nginx? That way you dont have to add this file as a plugin etc?]]></description>

I didn&#039;t say it was impossible to keep them, but it is much less likely.  If it can be done via a plugin it should be done via a plugin (in most cases).]]></description>

In my WordPress was a some modification, and if core wordpress upgrade, I merge the upgrade to my SVN repo.
So I don&#039;t loose this modification :)]]></description>
