My post wasn&#039;t really about taxes, but the lack of honesty shown by so many.

I&#039;m all for joining in the process of changing things if you don&#039;t like the way they are.  I don&#039;t think committing fraud is a good way to show your displeasure with the status quo.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[While I genuinely share your lament for the crumbling cornerstones of society that are honesty and integrity, there is no dishonor in avoiding theft.  Taxation is merely polite armed robbery through the mail.  Im sure any other organized crime gang wishes it could operate as brazenly.  It would cut operating costs.

As a matter of principal, for the majority of my adult life Ive always tried to deal honestly with my fellow man, be they friend or stranger.  Alas, the more I realize that my countrymen are themselves mere willing members of America&#039;s two feuding political gangs who continually rob one another (with me in their crossfire) through their proxy extortionist thugs (the IRS), like you I also find myself re-evaluating my moral position versus society at large.

Still, at the end of the day avoiding a thief isnt defrauding the thief - it&#039;s just self-defense.]]></description>
