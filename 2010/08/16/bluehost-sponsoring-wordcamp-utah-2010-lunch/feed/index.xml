The other option would be to pay for the upgrade fee :-)

					<description><![CDATA[Blue Host is a great hosting service and a good value for the price.  In my daily work, I&#039;ve set up several Wordpress Websites for people who use Blue Host.

One observation that I do have about them, however, is that they do not provide full support for multi-site Wordpress installations without an upgrade fee.  Since this is where most of my clients want to be, I can&#039;t recommend that service anymore.  :(

I know it would be great to network with other Wordpress experts face-to-face and plan to attend one of the WordCamp events soon.  When is WordCamp coming to San Diego?  :)

Speaking of faces, the catering company sounds as though they produce great cuisine too!]]></description>
