In my daily work, I've set up several Wordpress Websites for people who use Blue Host.\n\nOne observation that I do have about them, however, is that they do not provide full support for multi-site Wordpress installations without an upgrade fee.  Since this is where most of my clients want to be, I can't recommend that service anymore.  :(\n\nI know it would be great to network with other Wordpress experts face-to-face and plan to attend one of the WordCamp events soon.  When is WordCamp coming to San Diego?  :)\n\nSpeaking of faces, the catering company sounds as though they produce great cuisine too!",
