I have seen bursts of spam on Twitter, though I don&#039;t recall any lately.  That might be because I have no problem un-following someone and intentionally keep the list of people I follow small.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Facebook is a double-edged sword; I love it and hate it. It is awesome to connect with friends and family but boundaries become blurred with business associates asking for friendship. I hate to ignore requests only to have them ask me in person, &quot;Hey did you get my FB friend request.&quot;  I reply, &quot;Um, er.....yeah!&quot;

The advent of lists has certainly made things better. But I have one guy that keeps inviting me to all these causes. I value his friendship but there is a limit man!

Sincerely.

Daniel Tetreault.

					<description><![CDATA[I have probably had 20 people try to add me as a &#039;friend&#039; that were clearly spam profiles. Not only does it harm the Facebook experience but it creates a sense that their security is not great which makes me worry about my personal information security. Do you know what steps are being taken to hammer down on this?]]></description>
