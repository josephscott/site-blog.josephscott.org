As for a whitelist approach, are there really that many new HTTP clients coming out that have broken compression support?  If most of the broken ones are older then it seems like less work to simply black list known problem clients.  As the Opera item highlights, there is often little motivation in updating a white list.  A black list might cause more pain in the short term (when a new broken client shows up), but that pain would lead to motivation in making sure the list is up to date.\n\nMaking the white list that Google Library is using to determine feature support public would be really helpful.  Including test methodologies and contact info for sending in updates would allow others to help keep the list up to date.",
