I know in Modesto I was getting great speeds with Comcast too.  Other providers in the area are still over-promising and under-delivering.  

That includes DSL through AT&#038;T and ClearWire.

Cheers!]]></description>

That is entirely possible, it has been less than a day since my switch to Comcast.  If they in the 10Mb down I&#039;ll be happy, what I&#039;m really hoping for is better upload speeds.  Uploading images and video on DSL at well under 1Mb is rough.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[You must be either seeing them giving you that speed for only that burst as Comcast is known to do or you are in one of the lucky areas that have not yet oversold the bandwidth yet. From my experience with both companies Qwest delivers what they say they will while Comcast doesn&#039;t always deliver what they claim &#038; finds ways to trick speed tests. Test the downloads on torrents of a Linux DVD as a legal way to tell. Or download other large files to see if the speed stays that high.]]></description>
