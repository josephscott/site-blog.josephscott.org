Other providers in the area are still over-promising and under-delivering.  \n\nThat includes DSL through AT&amp;T and ClearWire.\n\nCheers!",

If they in the 10Mb down I'll be happy, what I'm really hoping for is better upload speeds.  Uploading images and video on DSL at well under 1Mb is rough.",
