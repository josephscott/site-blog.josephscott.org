					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;/2010/01/19/php-helpers-esc_html/#comment-3172&quot;&gt;Matt&lt;/a&gt;.

For html_print_r and html_var_dump, I did the same thing for my local code, they echo by default.  After more thought it seemed like the right thing to do.

I&#039;m not sure exactly what the right answer is for using these in a WordPress context.  Perhaps load them as a plugin and keep the conditional checks for function name collisions?

Thanks for the feedback.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[These are great, I have always had one that I used called pre_dump, which was var_dump wrapped in PRE tags and several others that I use for debugging purposes.

I recently decided to test yours out, and ran into at least 1 thing that would help me, which is to rename esc_html to something else.  I have always used auto_prepend_file to include these common helpers, and when doing so it of course conflicts with my WordPress install.

Also, and this is just me wanting to type less but, I think that html_print_r and html_var_dump should echo rather than return.

I know this wasn&#039;t really designed for my specific use case, but it does perform this job well.

In any case, thank you for these, it will surely help me out.]]></description>
