After more thought it seemed like the right thing to do.\n\nI'm not sure exactly what the right answer is for using these in a WordPress context.  Perhaps load them as a plugin and keep the conditional checks for function name collisions?\n\nThanks for the feedback.",

I have always used auto_prepend_file to include these common helpers, and when doing so it of course conflicts with my WordPress install.\n\nAlso, and this is just me wanting to type less but, I think that html_print_r and html_var_dump should echo rather than return.\n\nI know this wasn't really designed for my specific use case, but it does perform this job well.\n\nIn any case, thank you for these, it will surely help me out.",
