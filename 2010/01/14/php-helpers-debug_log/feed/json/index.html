I also made a little log function recently.\n\nOne of the things I ran into was the filename which you set by default and I had the same idea (i made one log functions for a html log and one for a clear text log) (the html log shows different colors based on the importance)\n\n<code>\nfunction EDL_HTML_LOG($msg=\"undefined\", $level=0, $logDirFile='log/log.html') {</code>\n\nBut... if one of the apps has a different location for the log file that would not be handy repeating it over and over. So I made a little wrapper function in the same php page:\n\n<code>\nfunction Logger($msg=\"undefined\", $level=0) {\n\tEDL_HTML_LOG($msg,$level,LOGFILE_HTML);\n}\n</code>\n\nThe LOGFILE_HTML can now be set as a define in the appliation.\n\nHowever, this is still not satisfying since what if the user (uh..thats me) forgets to define the location of the Log file in of the applications.",
