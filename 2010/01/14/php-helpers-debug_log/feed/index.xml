I haven&#039;t had a need to change the file name for the debug log.  I made it an option though on the off chance that it comes up later on.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I was lately also thinking of starting a little set of generic functions. I also made a little log function recently.

One of the things I ran into was the filename which you set by default and I had the same idea (i made one log functions for a html log and one for a clear text log) (the html log shows different colors based on the importance)

&lt;code&gt;
function EDL_HTML_LOG($msg=&quot;undefined&quot;, $level=0, $logDirFile=&#039;log/log.html&#039;) {&lt;/code&gt;

But... if one of the apps has a different location for the log file that would not be handy repeating it over and over. So I made a little wrapper function in the same php page:

&lt;code&gt;
function Logger($msg=&quot;undefined&quot;, $level=0) {
	EDL_HTML_LOG($msg,$level,LOGFILE_HTML);
}
&lt;/code&gt;

The LOGFILE_HTML can now be set as a define in the appliation.

However, this is still not satisfying since what if the user (uh..thats me) forgets to define the location of the Log file in of the applications.]]></description>
