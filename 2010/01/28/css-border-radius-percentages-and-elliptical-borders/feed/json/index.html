Just apply the HTC to the elements you need rounded corners on.\n\nIt actually has more correct support than Fx (firefox has it's percent references backwards; 25% on the X side ends up being % of height), and more robust support than Webkit (i.e., it does percentages).\n\nI have no idea how it does the job, but it's making button-creation /so damn simple/.",
