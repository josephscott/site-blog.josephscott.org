					<description><![CDATA[Great article !
Is there any way to get the full repository path in the notification email?
Currently I get &quot;trunk/project/......&quot; while it would be great to have the full path as we have the subversion service through http with apache and would be able to navigate directly to the file. Something like:
&quot;http://svn.mydomain.com/projectName/trunk/project....&quot;

Thanks in advance.]]></description>

You may need a longer delay before the notifier runs so as to ensure you are not catching the svnsync username.

You could make it check the username and loop if the username for the revision is still svnsync.]]></description>

If you enable the ability to edit rev-props using a hook in the repo (which I think you have to do for svnsync anyway) then you can easily change the username associated with a log message.

You can do this as a one time script which runs through each revision on write a hook to do it for each revision as it is synced (as long as you can hook in after svnsync has set the username)]]></description>

Peter Westwood&#039;s suggestion worked for awhile, but for some reason has stopped working for me.  This could be due to changes on the main repo, I&#039;m not sure.

I&#039;m not aware of specific method for changing usernames with svn hooks, but I wouldn&#039;t be surprised if someone has done that before.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi!

Did you sort the issue regarding that all commits where done by the user running svnsync?

I&#039;m trying to move my subversion from an online service to our own local network and all commits are done by the user running the svnsync. And to make it even harder all the usernames have changed from the old repository to the new one.

Do you know of any way to change the usernames with svn hooks? On the external online service we use our complete mail address as usernames but the local one only use the domain username. So I need to strip away &quot;@domain.com&quot; in the username that does the commit......

Any ideas?]]></description>

Cool.

I guess the output redirect difference may be just a shell configuration thing.

I just googled what to use as I can never remember ;-)]]></description>

Nice!
I had to make just one small fix, I changed the last line to:

&lt;code&gt;delayed_notify $1 $2 &#062;&#038;2 /dev/null &#038;&lt;/code&gt;

Without that I&#039;d get an error, post-commit: 28: Syntax error: Bad fd number
I guess it doesn&#039;t assume STDERR.

Not a big deal, but I usually do the ordering on this differently: &lt;code&gt;&#062; /dev/null 2&#062;&#038;1&lt;/code&gt;
so that it reads out loud like, redirect STDOUT to /dev/null and redirect STDERR to STDOUT

Thanks again, I just confirmed that this works.  I now get the correct username in the commit emails.  I&#039;ll update the post with your example.]]></description>

This will do it.

This will fork and sleep before doing the notify so that you catch the revprop changes as well.

You need to tune the sleep time based on how big the revprop changes take.  10 seconds is probably far too long.

&lt;code&gt;
#!/bin/sh

delayed_notify() {
        sleep 10
        /usr/bin/svnnotify --repos-path &quot;$1&quot; --revision &quot;$2&quot; 
        --to commit-list@example.com 
        --from commit-list@example.com 
        --with-diff 
        --subject-cx 
        --subject-prefix &#039;REPO-NAME &#039; 
        --handler HTML::ColorDiff
}

delayed_notify $1 $2 &#062;&#038; /dev/null &#038;
&lt;/code&gt;]]></description>
