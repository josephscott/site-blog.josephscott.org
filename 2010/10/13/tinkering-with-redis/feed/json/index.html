I'm not convinced it is the right approach for everyone (looks like another SPOF).\n\nThere are certainly other issues in Redis, some of them bigger than others depending on how you use it.  I don't see any of them being complete show stoppers though and on the flip side there seems to be plenty of potential for the future of Redis.",
