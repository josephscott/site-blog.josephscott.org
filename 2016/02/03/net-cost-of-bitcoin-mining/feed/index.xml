					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/02/03/net-cost-of-bitcoin-mining/#comment-4441&quot;&gt;Alt Jensen&lt;/a&gt;.

If the math looks like:

&lt;code&gt;( 650,000 kWh / 160 Bitcoins mined per hour ) * $0.15 USD per kWh = $609.38 in electricity per Bitcoin mined&lt;/code&gt;

Then lowering the $0.15 cost of electricity to $0.027 would be:

&lt;code&gt;( 650,000 kWh / 160 Bitcoins mined per hour ) * $0.027 USD per kWh = $109.69 in electricity per Bitcoin mined&lt;/code&gt;

Then all of the Bitcoin miners need to move to data centers located in Chelan County, Washington :-)

According to your EIA link, the average industrial rate across the US is $0.0662.  That would come out to $268.94.  The commercial average is $0.1036, for a per mined amount of $420.88.  So Bitcoin could still easily be in the red.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Fair enough. Even then, we&#039;re missing the factor of demand. Right now, Bitcoin is still very much a niche product, although it shows some traction of going mainstream. Even if Bitcoin was trading at 3x cost, it needs mass market support. I just don&#039;t see it. I&#039;m hopeful, but skeptical.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[His conclusions are also based on a high price for electricity.  You can bet that the people currently mining aren&#039;t paying $0.15/kWh, I only pay $0.09/kWh at home and if I was on a commercial plan, I&#039;d be paying even less.
This power company only charges $0.027/kWh

It&#039;s also interesting how much the cost of electricity varies from state to state https://www.eia.gov/electricity/monthly/epm_table_grapher.cfm?t=epmt_5_6_a]]></description>

Right, my point was that this conclusion is based on current values for Bitcoin.  If the values doubled or tripled then that would alter the math significantly.

People have a long history of long history of not paying the fully loaded cost of a product.  Especially when it comes to the environmental impacts.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My conclusion is made from 2 results- at current rates, we&#039;re spending more money to mine Bitcoin than the return, and the result is a dozen tons of carbon dioxide dumped into the atmosphere on a daily basis. I&#039;m not aware of any other product from Computer Science that is so inefficient (at a loss!) and so environmentally unfriendly than *coin mining.]]></description>
