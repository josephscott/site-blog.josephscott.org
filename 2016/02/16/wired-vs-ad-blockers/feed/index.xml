					<description><![CDATA[If advertisers didn&#039;t completely obliterate trust, and web designers didn&#039;t completely destroy screen real estate with ad presence, that seems like a likely possibility.

I suspect few people using ad-blockers will do that.  You&#039;d need to be very convincing that none of your ad networks are abusing their powers ( or, you know, distributing malware ).  Trust has been eroded so badly that getting it back is going to be very hard.]]></description>

That is definitely an angle this that they have to consider.  I would certainly be less likely to link to an article that was behind a paywall.

If they implement an easy way to bypass the paywall, then the ad-blockers will leverage that in a heart beat.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m curious about the impact this will have on traffic and other kinds of growth. I&#039;d have to imagine folks will be less inclined to link to an article on such a site, so an article&#039;s potential to go viral would probably suffer.

I wonder how they&#039;d address this. I know, for example, if you check out a NY Times article from Google News, that the paywall is bypassed.]]></description>

My gut feeling is this is an arms race that Wired will not be able to win.  Their best hope is to avoid letting it get to that point in the first place.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Fantastic writeup. It seems that Wired recognized that putting all articles behind a paywall will most certainly negatively impact their business model, so they seems to have settled on a middle-ground: ads or paywall. Well, as you mentioned, let&#039;s see what wins out- stealth ad blocking or paying for subscriptions. Somehow, as you concluded, I&#039;m willing to bet the former wins over the latter.]]></description>
