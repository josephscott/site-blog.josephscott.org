					<description><![CDATA[I really like mine too, especially the heartrate and activity charts in the online dashboard.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Instead what I’ve started doing is to wear the HR until it runs out of juice completely, then plug in.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I got the Surge, and I&#039;ve found that charging it while I shower and get dressed gives it enough juice to last about four days.]]></description>
