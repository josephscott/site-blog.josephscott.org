Yes, I use the budget features as well.  I agree that if you don&#039;t follow their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youneedabudget.com/method&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;four rules&lt;/a&gt; then it does add a bit more complexity.

					<description><![CDATA[Do you use the budgeting features at all? I&#039;ve tried to, but their system is maybe just too complicated for me. After a bit I always end up just using it more as an expense tracker, just to see if I spending too much on this or that.]]></description>
