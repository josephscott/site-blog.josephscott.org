Steve Jobs wanted Flash dead years ago and even though I have to agree that Flash is sub-optimal, it's clear today that it's still a very widely used solution.\nAs much as it pains me to accept it, Flash is still the only way to do a lot of things (like Copy/Paste in a single button click for example...) and I wish the \"web platform\" folks would focus a bit less on \"video\" and more on the general idea that the web needs to provide compleling solutions to what Flash solves!",
