I agree with the general approach: provide methods to implement the features that currently require Flash.

For the specific category of video, I consider this done.  For generally available videos like this I really see no reason to use Flash.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[One of my 2015 resolution was to disable Flash in my browsers.... and I have to say it&#039;s a very sad experience. Steve Jobs wanted Flash dead years ago and even though I have to agree that Flash is sub-optimal, it&#039;s clear today that it&#039;s still a very widely used solution.
As much as it pains me to accept it, Flash is still the only way to do a lot of things (like Copy/Paste in a single button click for example...) and I wish the &quot;web platform&quot; folks would focus a bit less on &quot;video&quot; and more on the general idea that the web needs to provide compleling solutions to what Flash solves!]]></description>
