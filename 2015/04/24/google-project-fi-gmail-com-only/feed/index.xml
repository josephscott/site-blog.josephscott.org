					<description><![CDATA[I encountered the same issue, so I requested an invite using an old gmail account that I no longer use. Now I&#039;m wondering if I activate that invite (whenever I get one), will I be able to use my normal (custom-domain) Google account?

When Google recently opened up Inbox to everyone with @gmail.com addresses I assumed it wouldn&#039;t work with my Google Apps account either. Someone sent me an invite anyway, and it works completely fine with the custom domain. I&#039;ve heard the reasoning is Google Apps accounts are for paying customers (although many free ones are grandfathered in), so new services aren&#039;t offered to them until they&#039;re proven stable.

Too bad that trying that experiment with Fi requires buying a Nexus 6. Hopefully someone who already has the phone and a custom domain will get a Fi invite via another account, and let everyone know.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Same disappointment here. I use gmail via a custom domain through Google Apps, and despite being squarely in the Google ecosystem and owning a Nexus 6, I cannot sign up for Fi unless I create a separate @gmail address to run it through (which Apps will not let me alias to my domain&#039;s users). :(]]></description>
