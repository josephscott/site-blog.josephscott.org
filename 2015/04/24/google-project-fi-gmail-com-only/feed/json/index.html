Now I'm wondering if I activate that invite (whenever I get one), will I be able to use my normal (custom-domain) Google account?\n\nWhen Google recently opened up Inbox to everyone with @gmail.com addresses I assumed it wouldn't work with my Google Apps account either. Someone sent me an invite anyway, and it works completely fine with the custom domain. I've heard the reasoning is Google Apps accounts are for paying customers (although many free ones are grandfathered in), so new services aren't offered to them until they're proven stable.\n\nToo bad that trying that experiment with Fi requires buying a Nexus 6. Hopefully someone who already has the phone and a custom domain will get a Fi invite via another account, and let everyone know.",
