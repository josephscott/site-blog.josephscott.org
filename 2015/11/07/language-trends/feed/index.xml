					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/11/07/language-trends/#comment-4396&quot;&gt;Shawn McKenna&lt;/a&gt;.

JavaScript has some odd quirks, just like most other complex systems.  I&#039;m still not entirely sure what to make of JavaScript on the server side.  The client and server side worlds tend to have different strengths and weaknesses.

That said there are a number of people who like the idea of writing one language, JavaScript, on both sides.  My gut feeling is that will end up in the same situation that Java &quot;write once, run anywhere&quot; did: an appealing idea that didn&#039;t really pan out the way we thought it would.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello Joe, 

Hope you are doing well. 

I read a few books on PHP and I pay attention to your posts here which often go over many 3rd party libraries.  But I have not had any projects on it (I will not with this job, but I do want to keep prepared).

Java is still quite popular here (or at least in silicon valley as opposed to central valley.)  I remember here when the initial complaints were that it was too slow.  After a few versions there were quite big improvements, especially in reflection.  C# is popular in mid-to-small applications and I will see a good amount of jobs up in Sacramento, but not as much in silicon valley. 

An interesting trend I have heard from several people I have talked to (this is completely anecdotal) but they were mentioning they wanted to learn more about C++.  I took several courses in C and one in C++, but was never overly enamored with the language.  

And then their is JavaScript.  A little hard to get away from if you are doing any client-side work for a web application :D.  I&#039;ve worn out a few David Flanagan books on the subject especially JavaScript: The Definitive Guide.  I wonder how many people first learned doing HTML, CSS and JavaScript.  Still sometimes it is a language I curse at.  Sometimes I find server-side developers who just try to avoid JavaScript at all costs.]]></description>
