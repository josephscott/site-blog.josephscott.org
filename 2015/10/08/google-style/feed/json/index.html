They even state: \"Things would probably be different if we had to do it all over again from scratch.\"\n\nWhile checked exceptions can be overused (some languages do not have this like C#, Java does), they do have a use.  Plus unchecked exceptions (runtime) are a whole lot easier to create maintainable code then without (given a good-to-great programmer.) \n\nStyle guides are important for consistency of code.  Every company should have them.  I use them for the projects that I am on (of course I created them so I do have some bias).
