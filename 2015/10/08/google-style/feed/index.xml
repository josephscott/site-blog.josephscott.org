&lt;blockquote&gt;I created them so I do have some bias&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Well, at least you have no one else to blame :-)  Given enough developers there will always be disagreements about style.

The biggest help to having a style guide is having an automated tool that checks code against the guide rules.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[At first I was incredulous after reading &quot;never use exceptions.&quot; After reading through their guide (the C++ one; in Java they do use exceptions) it ends up being a pragmatic reason and not a philosophical one.  They had coded themselves into it basically (an overuse of error codes.)  They even state: &quot;Things would probably be different if we had to do it all over again from scratch.&quot;

While checked exceptions can be overused (some languages do not have this like C#, Java does), they do have a use.  Plus unchecked exceptions (runtime) are a whole lot easier to create maintainable code then without (given a good-to-great programmer.) 

Style guides are important for consistency of code.  Every company should have them.  I use them for the projects that I am on (of course I created them so I do have some bias).  It helps later on, especially if you bring in another programmer, to keep maintainable and consistent code (of course you do need informal/formal code reviews as well.)]]></description>
