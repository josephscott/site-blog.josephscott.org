					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m actually convinced that more and more, JS is the replacing HTML at the &quot;heart&quot; of the web stack. Let&#039;s face it, the web as it was built is now more and more unbundled: your html docs are not only/always served via HTTP (it could be/have been spdy, but also things like websockets, or even SSE, or they may have been loaded locally... or just &quot;built&quot; locally via JS), CSS is now threated to be replaced by writting JS code... etc.

(I&#039;m not saying it&#039;s a *good* trend... but I think this is happening and faster than we expect). It goes even further: Service Workers are now making JS execute *before* the network stack is even touched!]]></description>
