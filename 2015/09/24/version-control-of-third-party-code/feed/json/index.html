If you have a multiple version line often some jars will not work with say a particular application server (I have clients on different ones like JBoss and WebLogic), but more importantly if you have a client that lags on a version, but needs a critical fix (and say you updated the third party software in a later version) you need that older version readily available (checkout the code to a sandbox, make the modification, commit the work, and if their is continuous integration set-up like Jenkins that's all the work you need to do to have a verified build and ear file -- not counting of course if you have specific ant properties that need to be changed.) *  \n\n* note there are some philosophies believe more in a unstable branch and stable trunk (default in Mercurial), but I found that version branches should always remain stable and ultimately prefer an unstable trunk (though sometimes you might even need to have a couple of unstable tags if you are doing R&amp;D in different areas.)  But I also believe that the trunk and branch versions should all trigger a continuous integration build.  Tends to make life simpler.  A side note I never liked that concept of hazing people who break the build. \n\nAlso it is important to version control DDL as well as anything that can possible change for a client(s) like archaic PL/SQL scripts (I tend to keep migration scripts in version control as well),  etcetera, etcetera, etcetera.  \n\nShawn from Riverbank/Modesto :)",
