No doubt.  That doesn&#039;t help the large number of companies that are deeply tied to AWS.  In those cases the only places they have local servers is where AWS DCs are located.]]></description>

That would not surprise me, and a feeling that is likely shared by many in other countries as well.

Unfortunately that is a problem that simply won&#039;t scale.  A startup ( and even most large companies ) can&#039;t possibly hope to keep data local in each country to avoid the potential problems of storage in one particular country ( the US in this case ).]]></description>
