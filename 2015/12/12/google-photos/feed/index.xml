					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/12/12/google-photos/#comment-4421&quot;&gt;julien&lt;/a&gt;.

Google keeping Photos around is really the main concern at this point ( which is a pretty big item ).  Because of the other economics around Google I&#039;m not sure that even having people pay for it would be enough to keep it around if someone high up decided it was time for it to go away.

That said, I suspect Google is cooking up other ways to leverage all of that image data.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/12/12/google-photos/#comment-4420&quot;&gt;Sheri&lt;/a&gt;.

The app has worked well on my iPhone 5S, search works pretty well, my wife can also upload photos to the same place.  Above getting the basics right the automated animated GIFs, galleries, and movies are nice.

I was concerned about the &quot;High quality&quot; unlimited storage option.  So far the quality has been good enough for me.  Given that I&#039;m doing all of it on an iPhone 5S that might not be saying much.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m in the *same* situation. Dropbox is dropping Carousel which we (my wife and I) loved...
Google Photos does indeed look amazing, and I know a coupl engineers who work on it and they&#039;re good<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="â„¢" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> people... but of course, Google has an awful track record when it comes to long term commitment to side-products... 

In a perfect world, there would be a way for me (and enough people) to say &quot;we&#039;ll commit X$ a year&quot; and google to say &quot;as long as K people commit X$/year we&#039;ll keep this up. If they commit Y$ (Y&#062;X), we&#039;ll make it better&quot;.

Eventually, thanks to Moore&#039;s Law, the only cost of such a product is the code of maintaining software.]]></description>
