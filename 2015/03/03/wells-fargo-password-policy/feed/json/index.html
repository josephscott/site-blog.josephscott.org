For instance, if they used bcrypt, then limiting it to 72 characters would be a good idea ( because bcrypt only uses the first 72 ).  You could hash the password with something else first and then feed the hash of the password to bcrypt to get around that limitation.  But if you were using bcrypt directly then I'd be fine with a 72 character limit.\n\nIn general, allowing for an unlimited size for a password probably isn't a good idea either.  Do you really want to feed a 15 MB string into your password hashing algorithm?  Instead, a hard limit of something like a 1,000 characters, no matter what hashing system you are using, would be reasonable.",
