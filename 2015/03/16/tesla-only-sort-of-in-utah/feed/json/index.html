            "content_html": "I wrote to my rep, Rebecca Houck, and here's why she said she voted no: \n\n<blockquote>Hi, Lance,\n\nI appreciate your inquiry.  It was my attempt to be deliberative and cautious that has caused some to question my intention related to my \u201cno\u201d vote on the Tesla bill.  I am not averse to Tesla being in this market and allowing them some mechanism by which they can sell directly to customers.    In the case of HB394, I knew that additional amendments added to the original legislation might have been optimal, and consensus driven.  However, when the bill came to a vote (merely hours after the amended language had been released), I hadn\u2019t had the time to review the amendments thoroughly and opted to vote \u201cno.\u201d  Rep. Patrice Arent even tried to get the bill circled (that's when we set it aside for a bit --even just an hour or so--so we could look at the changes and talk to all involved about them), but that motion was defeated. \n\n I have a tendency to support bills that have been worked on over the interim, if they provide pretty substantive changes to current practice.   At a minimum, I have found that bills that are rushed through at the end of the session seem to often have problems.  I am hoping that the sponsor will work the bill through the interim, and I will connect with the stakeholders involved to see how this is coming along.  A good example of doing this effectively is the bill that was passed to support UBER and Lyft.  Even though the taxi companies weren't totally happy with it, it was something that had been fashioned with compromise and discussion since last year and I was more than happy to support it.   By contrast,  the Tesla folks came to present their case on the bill to our caucus only a week or so before the end of the session. \n\nThanks again for your advocacy.  Hopefully, we can get something situated for next year!\n\n\nRep. Rebecca Chavez-Houck\nMinority Whip\nUtah House of Representatives</blockquote>",
