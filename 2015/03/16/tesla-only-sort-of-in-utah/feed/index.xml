					<description><![CDATA[I wrote to my rep, Rebecca Houck, and here&#039;s why she said she voted no: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;Hi, Lance,

I appreciate your inquiry.  It was my attempt to be deliberative and cautious that has caused some to question my intention related to my “no” vote on the Tesla bill.  I am not averse to Tesla being in this market and allowing them some mechanism by which they can sell directly to customers.    In the case of HB394, I knew that additional amendments added to the original legislation might have been optimal, and consensus driven.  However, when the bill came to a vote (merely hours after the amended language had been released), I hadn’t had the time to review the amendments thoroughly and opted to vote “no.”  Rep. Patrice Arent even tried to get the bill circled (that&#039;s when we set it aside for a bit --even just an hour or so--so we could look at the changes and talk to all involved about them), but that motion was defeated. 

 I have a tendency to support bills that have been worked on over the interim, if they provide pretty substantive changes to current practice.   At a minimum, I have found that bills that are rushed through at the end of the session seem to often have problems.  I am hoping that the sponsor will work the bill through the interim, and I will connect with the stakeholders involved to see how this is coming along.  A good example of doing this effectively is the bill that was passed to support UBER and Lyft.  Even though the taxi companies weren&#039;t totally happy with it, it was something that had been fashioned with compromise and discussion since last year and I was more than happy to support it.   By contrast,  the Tesla folks came to present their case on the bill to our caucus only a week or so before the end of the session. 

Thanks again for your advocacy.  Hopefully, we can get something situated for next year!
