					<description><![CDATA[Mmh I know... it&#039;s been over a decade ago when this must-use plugin snippet was first launched... since then, I&#039;ve been religiously copying it to all my websites running WP over nginx.

After all these years, I wonder if the underlying issue has been &#039;fixed&#039; by Automattic at the WP core level? In other words — is this &#039;pretty permalinks&#039; workaround for nginx still necessary, on contemporary (uh, 2021) versions of WP/nginx?

I&#039;m just curious — leaving the must-use plugin around seems not to have any harmful effect, so, unless told otherwise, I&#039;ll keep it there...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Vivint has averaged three calls a day to my house. I look at caller ID and never answer. I am on the do not call list, but obviously they circumvent the list.
Finally blocked their number after their third call today! They are relentless. They even learned to han up after the second ring so they don&#039;t have to listen to the voice message.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Totally incorrect and kinda naieve. Thought it was pretty common knowledge the 9/10 was purely for the psychological effect of seeing a lower number for the price. Also, You pay what you pay. Skimming a fraction of a sale is called theft. Most cards can be charged fractions. Since the practice of 9/10 is quite a bit older than credit cards.]]></description>

This is definitely a time for all hands on deck.  Another metric that would point to how we are doing: the time between when a vaccine shipment is received and when it is given.  Until we are over this pandemic I would be expect that to be 5 days or less.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thank you, this is worthwhile bringing to everyone&#039;s attention (and comports with my own calculations.) Given that every infection could result in death, 1 in every 200 known Utah infections have died so far, and we&#039;re experiencing over 2,000 known new cases per day, we are likely to see hundreds more Covid deaths. The vaccination part of preventing these deaths couldn&#039;t be more important. I&#039;m with those demanding all deliberate speed including 24/7 administration of the shots. Gov-elect Cox and Director Saunders must see that it happens. Any delay whatever is unconscionable.]]></description>

Safari has an option for it, under &lt;code&gt;Develop &gt; Experimental Features &gt; Lazy Image Loading&lt;/code&gt;.  I haven&#039;t heard anything about when that would be promoted to a regular option ( enabled by default ).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I also think it&#039;s important to reflect on what you&#039;ve done right and what you&#039;ve done wrong every day, so you can see what you&#039;ve gained and what you&#039;ve lost, and that&#039;s important for our growth.
