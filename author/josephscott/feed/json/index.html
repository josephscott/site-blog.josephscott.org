This year it feels even more important.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Have I done any good in the world today?<br />\nHave I helped anyone in need?<br />\nHave I cheered up the sad and made someone feel glad?<br />\nIf not, I have failed indeed.<br />\nHas anyone\u2019s burden been lighter today<br />\nBecause I was willing to share?<br />\nHave the sick and the weary been helped on their way?<br />\nWhen they needed my help was I there?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I am a strong believer in service to others.  Yes, you feel good afterwards, and others get help that they can use, but there are times where it is more than all of that combined.  I&#8217;ve watched service change the hearts of people, those that are giving and those that are receiving.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>There are chances for work all around just now,<br />\nOpportunities right in our way.<br />\nDo not let them pass by, saying, \u201cSometime I\u2019ll try,\u201d<br />\nBut go and do something today.<br />\n\u2019Tis noble of man to work and to give;<br />\nLove\u2019s labor has merit alone.<br />\nOnly he who does something helps others to live.<br />\nTo God each good work will be known.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If one or two people coming together to serve is good, having a large group assemble for the purpose of serving others can be amazing. There is a special power in a multitude of individuals united in a single good cause.

            "content_text": "I&#8217;ve long been a fan of the hymn &quot;Have I Done Any Good?&quot; that we sing at church. This year it feels even more important.\n\nHave I done any good in the world today?\nHave I helped anyone in need?\nHave I cheered up the sad and made someone feel glad?\nIf not, I have failed indeed.\nHas anyone\u2019s burden been lighter today\nBecause I was willing to share?\nHave the sick and the weary been helped on their way?\nWhen they needed my help was I there?\n\nI am a strong believer in service to others.  Yes, you feel good afterwards, and others get help that they can use, but there are times where it is more than all of that combined.  I&#8217;ve watched service change the hearts of people, those that are giving and those that are receiving.\n\nThere are chances for work all around just now,\nOpportunities right in our way.\nDo not let them pass by, saying, \u201cSometime I\u2019ll try,\u201d\nBut go and do something today.\n\u2019Tis noble of man to work and to give;\nLove\u2019s labor has merit alone.\nOnly he who does something helps others to live.\nTo God each good work will be known.\n\nIf one or two people coming together to serve is good, having a large group assemble for the purpose of serving others can be amazing.
