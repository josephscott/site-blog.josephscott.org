										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You have likely heard of &#8220;The Golden Rule&#8221;, which is usually described as: treat other people the way that you want to be treated.  The New Testament version comes from <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/matt/7?lang=eng">Matthew 7:12</a> ( emphasis mine ):</p>
<blockquote><p>
12 <strong>Therefore all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them</strong>: for this is the law and the prophets.
</p></blockquote>
<p>While talking with others about the current political situation I thought of a version of this that could be applied specifically to politics:</p>
<blockquote><p>
<strong>Govern in the way that you would want an opposing party to govern.</strong>
</p></blockquote>
<p>That is to say that while your policies and agenda may be different, the way you go about it should be completely above board and beyond reproach.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My <a href="/2021/01/01/utah-vaccination-math/">rough math for number of vaccines Utah needs to be giving each day</a> was 15,000.  Unfortunately <a href="https://coronavirus-dashboard.utah.gov/#vaccines">https://coronavirus-dashboard.utah.gov/#vaccines</a> only provides the total number of vaccines that have been given.  While that is helpful, it isn&#8217;t enough to determine if the pace is sufficient to get it to everyone who wants it by 1 September 2021.  For that we need daily numbers, and to track that trend over time ( they do this for covid-19 cases and deaths ).</p>
<p>I decided to solve that problem myself with a simple <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRLswt3xO8ckCQktr6RbAwWtGeu3ujqUK0LYLe97hE-vwxNFmtzWJSVDnVLwstYij7O5igCJmFDVMAt/pubhtml#">spreadsheet</a>.  I&#8217;m noting the total for each day and comparing it to the previous day to come up with the daily numbers. There are daily numbers for both the vaccinations given and the vaccine doses that have been received.</p>
<p><iframe height="500" src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRLswt3xO8ckCQktr6RbAwWtGeu3ujqUK0LYLe97hE-vwxNFmtzWJSVDnVLwstYij7O5igCJmFDVMAt/pubhtml?widget=true&amp;headers=false"></iframe></p>
<p>To make it easy to tell which days are over and under the 15,000 target I&#8217;ve applied condition formatting.  Pink for days with less than 15,000 and green for days with more than 15,000.  Nothing fancy, but it is effective at communicating the data in a glance.</p>
<p>Unfortunately I wasn&#8217;t able to find the total doses shipped for December 18th, 19th, 20th, 24th, 25th, and 31st; and January 1st and 3rd.  Those are noted by an asterisk next to them and on those days I used the previous known value.</p>
<p>The 2nd of January is the only day over 15,000 &#8211; at 16,174, but that covers multiple days due to the New Year&#8217;s Day holiday.  Today the daily number was 7,568 vaccinations, our highest single day number so far.  Unfortunately is only half of my estimated minimum of 15,000 per day that we&#8217;ll need to get it out to everyone by 1 September 2021.</p>
<p>Honestly, I&#8217;d rather they targeted a minimum of 25,000 vaccinations per day.  I realize that supply would need to keep up with that as well, which has other challenges.</p>
<p>A read-only version of the spreadsheet is publicly available at <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRLswt3xO8ckCQktr6RbAwWtGeu3ujqUK0LYLe97hE-vwxNFmtzWJSVDnVLwstYij7O5igCJmFDVMAt/pubhtml#">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRLswt3xO8ckCQktr6RbAwWtGeu3ujqUK0LYLe97hE-vwxNFmtzWJSVDnVLwstYij7O5igCJmFDVMAt/pubhtml#</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today a mob of Donald Trump supporters, and the Republican Party, attacked and invaded the United States Capitol building.  My heart is low as a I try to process what has happened.  For now, I will borrow the words of others who have attempted to describe this disgrace we have brought upon ourselves.</p>
<h3>James Matis</h3>
<blockquote><p>
Today’s violent assault on our Capitol, an effort to subjugate American democracy by mob rule, was fomented by Mr. Trump.  His use of the Presidency to destroy trust in our election and to poison our respect for fellow citizens has been enabled by pseudo political leaders whose names will live in infamy as profiles in cowardice.  Our Constitution and our Republic will overcome this stain and We the People will come together again in our never-ending effort to form a more perfect Union, while Mr. Trump will deservedly be left a man without a country.</p>
<p><cite><a href="https://twitter.com/evansiegfried/status/1346981168059715584">https://twitter.com/evansiegfried/status/1346981168059715584</a></cite>
</p></blockquote>
<h3>Barack Obama</h3>
<blockquote><p>
History will rightly remember today’s violence at the Capitol, incited by a sitting president who has continued to baselessly lie about the outcome of a lawful election, as a moment of great dishonor and shame for our nation. But we’d be kidding ourselves if we treated it as a total surprise.</p>
<p>For two months now, a political party and its accompanying media ecosystem has too often been unwilling to tell their followers the truth — that this was not a particularly close election and that President-Elect Biden will be inaugurated on January 20. Their fantasy narrative has spiraled further and further from reality, and it builds upon years of sown resentments. Now we’re seeing the consequences, whipped up into a violent crescendo.</p>
<p>Right now, Republican leaders have a choice made clear in the desecrated chambers of democracy. They can continue down this road and keep stoking the raging fires. Or they can choose reality and take the first steps toward extinguishing the flames. They can choose America.</p>
<p>I’ve been heartened to see many members of the President’s party speak up forcefully today. Their voices add to the examples of Republican state and local election officials in states like Georgia who’ve refused to be intimidated and have discharged their duties honorably. We need more leaders like these — right now and in the days, weeks, and months ahead as President-Elect Biden works to restore a common purpose to our politics. It’s up to all of us as Americans, regardless of party, to support him in that goal.</p>
<p><cite><a href="https://dayton247now.com/news/local/former-us-president-obama-releases-statement-on-chaos-at-us-capitol">https://dayton247now.com/news/local/former-us-president-obama-releases-statement-on-chaos-at-us-capitol</a></cite>
</p></blockquote>
<h3>Mitt Romney</h3>
<blockquote><p>
We gather today due to a selfish man’s injured pride and the outrage of his supporters whom he has deliberately misinformed for the past two months and stirred to action this very morning. What happened here today was an insurrection, incited by the President of the United States. Those who choose to continue to support his dangerous gambit by objecting to the results of a legitimate, democratic election will forever be seen as being complicit in an unprecedented attack against our democracy. They will be remembered for their role in this shameful episode in American history. That will be their legacy.</p>
<p>The objectors have claimed they are doing so on behalf of the voters. Have an audit, they say, to satisfy the many people who believe that the election was stolen. Please! No Congressional led audit will ever convince those voters, particularly when the President will continue to claim that the election was stolen. The best way we can show respect for the voters who are upset is by telling them the truth. That is the burden, and the duty, of leadership. The truth is that President-elect Biden won this election. President Trump lost. Scores of courts, the President’s own Attorney General, and state election officials both Republican and Democrat have reached this unequivocal decision.</p>
<p>We must not be intimidated or prevented from fulfilling our constitutional duty. We must continue with the count of electoral college votes. In light of today’s sad circumstances, I ask my colleagues: Do we weigh our own political fortunes more heavily than we weigh the strength of our Republic, the strength of our democracy, and the cause of freedom? What is the weight of personal acclaim compared to the weight of conscience?</p>
<p>Leader McConnell said that the vote today is the most important in his 40 plus years of public service. That is not because this vote reveals something about the election; it is because this vote reveals something about ourselves. I urge my colleagues to move forward with completing the electoral count, to refrain from further objections, and to unanimously affirm the legitimacy of the presidential election.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://peering.google.com/#/infrastructure">Google Network Infrastructure</a> page describes their various data center locations.  What really stood out was their &#8220;Edge Nodes (Google Global Cache, or GGC)&#8221; map:</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/google-edge-nodes.png"><img loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/google-edge-nodes.png" alt="" width="586" height="440" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-18373" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/google-edge-nodes.png 586w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/01/google-edge-nodes-300x225.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 586px) 100vw, 586px" /></a></p>
<p>Compare that to the map included in this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=910&#038;v=n4gOZrUwWmc">2014 Open Networking Summit talk</a>:</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/google-2014-cdn.png"><img loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/google-2014-cdn.png" alt="" width="916" height="531" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-18376" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/google-2014-cdn.png 916w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/01/google-2014-cdn-300x174.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/01/google-2014-cdn-768x445.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 916px) 100vw, 916px" /></a></p>
<p>I won&#8217;t bother trying to count the dots on each map ( and I haven&#8217;t been able to find a list of locations any where ), but I think it is safe to say that the number has increased significantly over the last <del>six</del> seven years.</p>
<p>At some point having a data center in your town will be at the same level as having local power, water, and sewer services.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With 2020 behind us, at least chronologically, there is a strong push to get the covid-19 pandemic under control through vaccinations.  As has been <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/12/29/covid-19-vaccine-distribution-slow-testing/">widely reported</a>, the initial rate of vaccination has been slower that what was originally hoped for.  That got me wondering what the math looks like for vaccinations here in Utah.</p>
<p>The stated goal for a <a href="https://coronavirus-download.utah.gov/Health/Vaccine_Timeline.pdf" title="vaccination timeline in Utah">vaccination timeline in Utah</a> is having it available to &#8220;All Utahns&#8221; some where between March and July 2021.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/utah-vaccine-timeline.png"><img loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/utah-vaccine-timeline-791x1024.png" alt="" width="580" height="751" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-18338" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/utah-vaccine-timeline-791x1024.png 791w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/01/utah-vaccine-timeline-232x300.png 232w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/01/utah-vaccine-timeline-768x994.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/01/utah-vaccine-timeline-1187x1536.png 1187w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/01/utah-vaccine-timeline-1200x1553.png 1200w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/01/utah-vaccine-timeline.png 1275w" sizes="(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px" /></a></p>
<p>To make the math easier let&#8217;s say we want all Utahns who want the vaccine to be able to get it by 1 September 2021.  Here is one way to break that down.</p>
<p>&#8211; 243 days <a href="https://asd.gsfc.nasa.gov/Craig.Markwardt/doy2021.html">between</a> 1 January 2021 and 1 September 2021<br />
&#8211; 3,205,958 people in Utah ( <a href="https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/UT">estimate from 1 July 2019</a>, <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/www.census.gov_quickfacts_UT.png">screenshot</a> )<br />
&#8211; Of those, 29% are under the age of 18, leaving 2,276,230 adults</p>
<p>The Pfizer vaccine has been approved for 16 and up, while Moderna is 18 and up.  Continuing the simple approach, let&#8217;s go with 18 and up across the board, it also lines up with the population reference.</p>
<p>At the high end we would vaccinate 2,276,230 people in 243 days.  That would be 9,368 vaccinations a day if these were single shot systems, but they are not.  Each requires two shots, a few weeks apart.  Doubling that brings to 18,736 vaccinations a day.</p>
<p>We are unlikely to need 100% vaccination under control though.  The exact percentage needed isn&#8217;t known for sure, we can safely say that it would need to be a significant portion of the population.  I will go with 75% here:</p>
<pre>
2,276,230 people * 0.75 = 1,707,172 people
1,707,172 people * vaccine shots = 3,414,344 shots
3,414,344 shots / 243 days = 14,051 shots per day
</pre>
<p>To get to 75% of those 18 and over in Utah by 1 September 2021 we need to be giving more than 14,000 shots per day.</p>
<p>If 14,000 plus is the target, how are we doing so far?  On 30 December 2020 we hit <a href="https://twitter.com/RobertGehrke/status/1344737146070913024">6,230 vaccinations</a>.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/twitter-shots.png"><img loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/twitter-shots-927x1024.png" alt="" width="580" height="641" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-18347" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/twitter-shots-927x1024.png 927w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/01/twitter-shots-272x300.png 272w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/01/twitter-shots-768x848.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/01/twitter-shots-1200x1325.png 1200w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/01/twitter-shots.png 1306w" sizes="(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px" /></a></p>
<p>We will need to more than double that.</p>
<p>This doesn&#8217;t address the other 29% of the population that is under the age of 18 &#8211; another 929,728 people.  Hopefully at some point during 2021 there will be a vaccine that will be approved for children.  If that happens then we&#8217;ll need even more capacity beyond the 14,000 target.  That could easily put us in the 15,000 to 16,000 shots per day range.</p>
<p>Given all of the variables, my rough math points me towards a <strong>minimum</strong> target of 15,000 vaccinations per day, every day.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve long been a fan of the hymn &quot;<a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/music/library/hymns/have-i-done-any-good?lang=eng" title="Have I Done Any Good?">Have I Done Any Good?</a>&quot; that we sing at <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/?lang=eng" title="church">church</a>. This year it feels even more important.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Have I done any good in the world today?<br />
Have I helped anyone in need?<br />
Have I cheered up the sad and made someone feel glad?<br />
If not, I have failed indeed.<br />
Has anyone’s burden been lighter today<br />
Because I was willing to share?<br />
Have the sick and the weary been helped on their way?<br />
When they needed my help was I there?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I am a strong believer in service to others.  Yes, you feel good afterwards, and others get help that they can use, but there are times where it is more than all of that combined.  I&#8217;ve watched service change the hearts of people, those that are giving and those that are receiving.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are chances for work all around just now,<br />
Opportunities right in our way.<br />
Do not let them pass by, saying, “Sometime I’ll try,”<br />
But go and do something today.<br />
’Tis noble of man to work and to give;<br />
Love’s labor has merit alone.<br />
Only he who does something helps others to live.<br />
To God each good work will be known.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If one or two people coming together to serve is good, having a large group assemble for the purpose of serving others can be amazing. There is a special power in a multitude of individuals united in a single good cause.  I highly recommend trying it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Then wake up and do something more<br />
Than dream of your mansion above.<br />
Doing good is a pleasure, a joy beyond measure,<br />
A blessing of duty and love.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the middle of a global pandemic service to others isn&#8217;t always the same as before.  So be creative, find a new way to do some good.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last week I generated some unexpected results by using <code>my_function()</code> instead of <code>my_function</code> as a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope/setTimeout" title="setTimeout">setTimeout</a> callback.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve never done that, what happens is <code>my_function()</code> will call the function right away.  That makes for an especially unhelpful result with <code>setTimeout</code>, where you would expect it to get called when the timer fires.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t even remember how many years ago I learned about the difference between the two, and I still managed to miss it at first glance.</p>
