I could buy a piece of \"Love Is\" gum for 200-300 rubles, depending on the day.  Rubles were the paper money, by the way.  I don't think I ever saw a one-ruble bill.  The exchange rate was around 5000-6000 rubles per dollar, again, depending on the day.  So even carrying 100 ruble bills was akin to carrying pennies.\n\nOnly children kept coins: they had absolutely no economic value, but they looked neat in jars, and they were great for play.  A few of the children I knew well had jars and jars of coins: not only tiny kopeks (which were worth .01 rubles) and other sub-ruble denominations, but 5, 10, and 50 ruble coins, too.  And then I think in 1997 or 1998, Russia decided to do just what you've hinted at here: they dropped the zeros, made new bills, and brought the coins back into regular circulation.\n\nEven then, the ruble didn't really stabilize, but I can only imagine what fun my little friends had with their coin-jars!  So now my kids and I keep jars of pennies, just in case.",
