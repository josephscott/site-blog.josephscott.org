In 1998 they didn&#039;t just devalue the rubble, Russia defaulted on their debt.  That was a bad time, and certainly something I wouldn&#039;t suggest the US do.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The Russians actually did something very similar to what you&#039;re proposing.  When I was there in 1996, I could buy a snickers bar for about 5,000 rubles.  I could buy a piece of &quot;Love Is&quot; gum for 200-300 rubles, depending on the day.  Rubles were the paper money, by the way.  I don&#039;t think I ever saw a one-ruble bill.  The exchange rate was around 5000-6000 rubles per dollar, again, depending on the day.  So even carrying 100 ruble bills was akin to carrying pennies.

Only children kept coins: they had absolutely no economic value, but they looked neat in jars, and they were great for play.  A few of the children I knew well had jars and jars of coins: not only tiny kopeks (which were worth .01 rubles) and other sub-ruble denominations, but 5, 10, and 50 ruble coins, too.  And then I think in 1997 or 1998, Russia decided to do just what you&#039;ve hinted at here: they dropped the zeros, made new bills, and brought the coins back into regular circulation.

Even then, the ruble didn&#039;t really stabilize, but I can only imagine what fun my little friends had with their coin-jars!  So now my kids and I keep jars of pennies, just in case.]]></description>
