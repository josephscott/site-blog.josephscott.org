					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve been tooling up on Node for a few months now; looking for excuses to build apps on it. Came across meteor about 10minutes ago, and the screencast has blown my mind. 

Reminds me of seeing the Rails screencasts for the first time years ago and thinking, &#039;this changes everything!&#039;.

I&#039;m definitely going to follow it&#039;s development! Looks like Node is coming of age!]]></description>
