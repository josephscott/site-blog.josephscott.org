					<description><![CDATA[It may sound stupid but I wanted to go ahead and update the event object in javascript like this:

 event.originalEvent = &#039;click&#039; or anything else.

Has anyone found a work around to that?

What I am trying to achieve:
I have been tasked with automating 13 clicks on a page and the way that I am doing this is by pasting a bunch of javascript on that page&#039;s console to simulate clicks.
 It was worked perfectly for 12 of the buttons, but the 13th button behaved in a weird way. It would only submit if I clicked it via my actual mouse and not with javascript. Now I don&#039;t have access to that page&#039;s code, else I would have changed things directly.
On more research( i.e your blog and other SO Pages) I found out that there is something known as orginalEvent which is undefined.
I want a way to change that considering my current limitations.
Please provide your thoughts if you can help! :)]]></description>
