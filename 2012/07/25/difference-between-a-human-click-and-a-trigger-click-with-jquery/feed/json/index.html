It would only submit if I clicked it via my actual mouse and not with javascript. Now I don't have access to that page's code, else I would have changed things directly.\r\nOn more research( i.e your blog and other SO Pages) I found out that there is something known as orginalEvent which is undefined.\r\nI want a way to change that considering my current limitations.\r\nPlease provide your thoughts if you can help! :)",
