					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;This is my take on it...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The odds of getting it right are 1/3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone seems to think that they end up being 1/2, but that&#039;s only if you make a selection after one choice has been removed - which is effectively what you are doing when you switch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So when you change your mind, you get a 1/2 change of getting it right.  If you don&#039;t you get a 1/3 chance of getting it right since he was always going to show you a goat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;:J&lt;/p&gt;
