					<description><![CDATA[I read constantly and to be honest I&#039;d never purchase a device like the Kindle. I realize the potential for devices like this, however i want to actually see the book and have it in my possession. I think companies  like Amazon and Apple want to make it popular to read on an electronic pad however If i had to play Nostradamus for a second Id be willing to bet that users of these devices will always be in the same group as Apple Vs PC or Apple and PC AKA &quot;I don&#039;t use them&quot;]]></description>
