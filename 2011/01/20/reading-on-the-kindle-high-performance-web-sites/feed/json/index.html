I realize the potential for devices like this, however i want to actually see the book and have it in my possession. I think companies  like Amazon and Apple want to make it popular to read on an electronic pad however If i had to play Nostradamus for a second Id be willing to bet that users of these devices will always be in the same group as Apple Vs PC or Apple and PC AKA \"I don't use them\"",

You have to do it on their website and you need to know your friend's Amazon account, but you can loan your ebook to them. After two weeks, the book automatically returns to your collection, so it's BETTER than a real book because when you loan it out, you KNOW you'll get it back.",
