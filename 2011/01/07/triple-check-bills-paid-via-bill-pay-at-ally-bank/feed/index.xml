					<description><![CDATA[Ally has the worst Bill Pay service in the industry.

Beware if you use it to pay people via paper checks. My payment was delayed 2 weeks, yes, that is 2 full weeks before the person I was supposed to pay received the check. Ally claimed they had already mailed the check and refused to do anything about it. This was the second occurence under a year.

I asked if I can pay by directly transferring funds to the other party&#039;s bank account. They tried to sell me on PopMoney, which is a third party service they have no control over. I couldn&#039;t send more than $1000 in a single transaction and they claimed they couldn&#039;t do anything about it.

Horrible service, won&#039;t fix your problems and they treat people with not much respect.]]></description>

I don&#039;t know any of the details of the inner workings of Ally bill pay, and quite honestly that is how it should be.  I just want it to work :-)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have had nothing but issue after issue with Ally&#039;s bill pay and have simply given up.  Like you, I tested the system with my electric bill and it ended up getting paid 3 times.  It takes Ally support nearly a week to ever respond to my emails and when I call them directly, I can never get anyone that even has a clue about their bill pay system.  I have been very satisfied with their savings products, but I will not use or recommend their bill pay offering.  It has been a total disaster. They should have just used Checkfree like most other banks rather than the crappy Yodlee platform.]]></description>

Thanks for checking in.  I did receive a phone call today following up on this issue.  Looks like it will be a few more days before I&#039;ll be able to confirm that the outstanding issues have been addressed.]]></description>
