My payment was delayed 2 weeks, yes, that is 2 full weeks before the person I was supposed to pay received the check. Ally claimed they had already mailed the check and refused to do anything about it. This was the second occurence under a year.\n\nI asked if I can pay by directly transferring funds to the other party's bank account. They tried to sell me on PopMoney, which is a third party service they have no control over. I couldn't send more than $1000 in a single transaction and they claimed they couldn't do anything about it.\n\nHorrible service, won't fix your problems and they treat people with not much respect.",

Like you, I tested the system with my electric bill and it ended up getting paid 3 times.  It takes Ally support nearly a week to ever respond to my emails and when I call them directly, I can never get anyone that even has a clue about their bill pay system.  I have been very satisfied with their savings products, but I will not use or recommend their bill pay offering.  It has been a total disaster. They should have just used Checkfree like most other banks rather than the crappy Yodlee platform.",
