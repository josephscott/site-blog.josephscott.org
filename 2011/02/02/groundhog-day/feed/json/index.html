What has happened is that the IPv4 blocks from ICANN have been all assigned to the regional NICs, which is turn will still be assigning out IPv4 blocks to customers.  So people will still be able to get new IPs.  Is this an event of significance?  Yes.  Has been over sensationalized compared to what has actually happened?  Yes.  The headline should read something like \"ICANN distributes final IPv4 blocks to regional NICs\".\n\nEven with everything that has happened people still haven't jumped to IPv6 in a big way.\n\nAnd then there are the giant wasted blocks of IPv4 space that could potentially be reclaimed.  Like do we really need to reserve all of 127.*.*.* just so that most folks can use just 127.0.0.1?  Also check out the large section of 'Future Use' blocks on http://www.iana.org/assignments/ipv4-address-space/ipv4-address-space.xml some of those likely could be put to use.",
