					<description><![CDATA[I rather like twenty eleven as a theme, which I am using on one of my sites. I did tweak it so that banners can be seen on all pages but there is something else I need to do and I wondered if anybody knows the answer....

When I installed the blog I had a site already on the domain, so I installed Wordpress in a directory /blog and that&#039;s great but I want to change it so that when you press the home button inside the blog it takes you to www.example.com and not www.example.com/blog. I&#039;ve tried changing the settings inside Wordpress but I get an error, so I&#039;m a bit lost and I wondered if this has to be done by changing the theme.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m liking twentyeleven so far myself. I see the popular thing is to hack that header down straight away. It&#039;s the same thing I did on VoodooPress within about 5 minutes. Wider theme, smaller header, move some stuff around. After a bit of tidying, twnetyelevn is OK in my books!]]></description>

The twenty eleven header size a bit larger than I&#039;d like.  As far as content vs. header, I think on some sites I&#039;d consider the header part of the content.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Eh, I&#039;m about ready for the massive-header fad to be over anyway.  What happened to content being the most important thing?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Yes! This theme needs a option for centered content and two sidebars; left and right. If it had that; I&#039;d use it in a heartbeat on my blog and rid myself of the theme I am using now. 

If I knew how to to mod the thing, I&#039;d do it myself and call it Twenty-Eleven Three. But I don&#039;t know how! :cry:

Anyhow, there&#039;s my suggestion for the theme itself.
