I did tweak it so that banners can be seen on all pages but there is something else I need to do and I wondered if anybody knows the answer....\n\nWhen I installed the blog I had a site already on the domain, so I installed Wordpress in a directory /blog and that's great but I want to change it so that when you press the home button inside the blog it takes you to www.example.com and not www.example.com/blog. I've tried changing the settings inside Wordpress but I get an error, so I'm a bit lost and I wondered if this has to be done by changing the theme.",
