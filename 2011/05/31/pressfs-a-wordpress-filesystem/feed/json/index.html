What this does is tell the request method to cache the results of an API call for 3 seconds, so any requests during that time for the exact same API call will get the cached results back.  I set this at 3 by default because I wanted just enough caching so that pressfs could get filesystem operations done with a minimum number of API calls, but not have to worry too much about serving stale data.\n\nCaching is definitely an area that needs some exploration, my thoughts have mainly been around doing the caching inside WP.",
