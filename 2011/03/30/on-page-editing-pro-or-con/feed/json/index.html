I believe it corresponds to another rule of thumb in UX design: make interactions as direct as possible. For example: rotating something in Powerpoint requires fiddling with knobs and buttons in a separate window. On the iPad, you just touch the thing you want to manipulate.\n\nAnother fringe issue with on-page editing is that it puts more burden on theme developers, since they have to style both the client-facing site and the admin. It's been interesting to see how the Drupal community copes with this (by default all of it's admin panels are displayed in the context of the site). A whole host of modules have been developed with the aim of easily giving Drupal a stock admin interface.",
