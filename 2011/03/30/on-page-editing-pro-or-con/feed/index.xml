					<description><![CDATA[&lt;blockquote cite=&quot;http://josephscott.org/archives/2011/03/on-page-editing-pro-or-con/&quot;&gt;on-page editing should be placed on a layer that is as close the user as possible&lt;/blockquote&gt;

That&#039;s a great rule of thumb. I believe it corresponds to another rule of thumb in UX design: make interactions as direct as possible. For example: rotating something in Powerpoint requires fiddling with knobs and buttons in a separate window. On the iPad, you just touch the thing you want to manipulate.

Another fringe issue with on-page editing is that it puts more burden on theme developers, since they have to style both the client-facing site and the admin. It&#039;s been interesting to see how the Drupal community copes with this (by default all of it&#039;s admin panels are displayed in the context of the site). A whole host of modules have been developed with the aim of easily giving Drupal a stock admin interface.]]></description>
