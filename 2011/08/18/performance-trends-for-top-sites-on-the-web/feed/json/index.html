And still bounce rate grows due to many 'other visitors' I reckon only micro-browse the web for a quick content that they could adopt or borrow or something like that to reproduce.  As I see it, Google is aware of this phenomena. Lovely. I am only ~300K rank.",

So while this data might not be perfect, it is something that is at least trackable, and therefore something that we can look for trends.\n\nThe single largest increase (in terms of raw kB) came from images, so more bandwidth would help there, but faster Javascript execution wouldn't.  On the bandwidth front things are strange too.  More people have better access to higher speed connections at their homes and offices, but are frequently using mobile connections that much slower.  So you end up with this odd 3 steps forward 2 back series of trends.",
