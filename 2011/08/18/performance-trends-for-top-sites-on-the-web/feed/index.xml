					<description><![CDATA[Also from an important statistics point of view, more or less related to your performance recap; how are other large sites deal with their bounce rate? I get average 3+ minutes in visitors spending on my pages. And still bounce rate grows due to many &#039;other visitors&#039; I reckon only micro-browse the web for a quick content that they could adopt or borrow or something like that to reproduce.  As I see it, Google is aware of this phenomena. Lovely. I am only ~300K rank.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;/2011/08/18/performance-trends-for-top-sites-on-the-web/#comment-3823&quot;&gt;Julien&lt;/a&gt;.

There are a number of things that we could add to come up with some sort of &#039;is the web getting faster&#039; metric, but many of those aren&#039;t easily or reliably quantifiable.  So while this data might not be perfect, it is something that is at least trackable, and therefore something that we can look for trends.

The single largest increase (in terms of raw kB) came from images, so more bandwidth would help there, but faster Javascript execution wouldn&#039;t.  On the bandwidth front things are strange too.  More people have better access to higher speed connections at their homes and offices, but are frequently using mobile connections that much slower.  So you end up with this odd 3 steps forward 2 back series of trends.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It would also be interesting to add in there the bandwidth speed improvments. We may also add the advent of &quot;modern&quot;/fast JS interpreters and I&#039;m pretty sure the web is &quot;faster&quot; than ever :)]]></description>
