					<description><![CDATA[httplib2 does handle connections differently than the built-in libraries and conveniently enables an on-disk cache (.cache by default). I chose it for a project that needed to manage connections more proactively than urllib, et al. A side effect of this is the response object maintains a reference and is therefore persistent allowing other code to be a bit more lazy. That can bite, for me it allowed for some cleaner code.

The auth bit you were at odds with is the _request method (__init__.py file). While I&#039;ve not poked at it in earnest, the change appears to be trivial to implement cleanly. I wanted to see if a guy could easily append the auth into the authorizations attribute but the way the first request is made precludes that from working it appears.

The one justification that may make a difference with the author is that some systems (some might say broken), do not play well without some from the start. I work with one vendor that requires basic-auth to prompt a 401 response for the next level. Like you, I simply send auth (both to the example) in the first headers and the full query URI for a single-step request and response.

Regardless of all this, I used the same method as you via custom headers. It was trivial and easily maintained.]]></description>
