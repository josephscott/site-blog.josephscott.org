					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;/2011/09/07/etag-survey/#comment-3830&quot;&gt;Joseph Scott&lt;/a&gt;.

Is it a piece of code that goes in the .htaccess file or is it set up in the httpd.conf file? I&#039;m at the very beginning of knowledge in this area and don&#039;t see some easy &quot;turn e-tags on&quot; button. I&#039;m hosted through GoDaddy and they tell me that it&#039;s a piece of code that goes in the .htaccess but that&#039;s all they could tell me. I have read that they are valuable to have - when done right - but can&#039;t seem to find out how to actually get it to be on the pages of my site.]]></description>

The Etag has no required definition as far as how to generate one.  In order for it to be useful for caching though it does need to be consistent.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[So, what is the proper way to do an Etag? I can&#039;t seem to find this information in an &quot;Etag for Dummies&quot; format. Where does it go? How do you ensure you have done it correctly? 

Thanks!]]></description>

If your server admins are incapable of configuring Etags correctly then it is is better to turn them off entirely.  No Etags are better than broken Etags.

But the best solution is still to use Etags correctly.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Joseph, 
as I have read on many places the use of ETAG is not quite recommended these days, instead the if modified thing is more in use. I would like to know your views on it.

- Thanks]]></description>
