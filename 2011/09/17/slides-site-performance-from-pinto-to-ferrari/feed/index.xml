Your previous comment caught me when I was checking email.  The comment moderation email from WordPress showed up at the same time :-)

For Apache there is http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/core.html#keepalive

For Nginx http://wiki.nginx.org/HttpCoreModule#keepalive_disable

Both default to enabling keep-alive.]]></description>

That was fast. I think faster that Vin Diesel&#039;s car. :) 
Is there any article or some sort of document that talks about how to do it..

And one more thing. When I clicked on the link that I got in my email with the notification of your reply - chrome game me an error of ssl and I had to click on proceed anyway - Just FYI.]]></description>

Yes, 

In your slide 41 I can see that there are multiple resources being sent in single http request. 

For example, on 3rd http request from s2.wp.com 6 resources are downloaded in single http request.

I am on linux sever with Apache and use latest wp (3.5.1).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey Joseph,

Just watched the video and Love it. 

I would really appreciate if you can point me in the right direction on where can I find more information about how to keep the connection open and not let it close and send more than one component in that connection.

Is it something related to mod_concat for lighttpd where we can send more than one css or js in one http request?

Is there any document or an article that talks about it specifically for wp?

Thanks,]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi, just watched the video of the presentation and since I am just in the process of moving a WP installation with 20 sites (which works kind of, but not exactly, like MS) and the first memory usage optimization that I have done is to turn off the innodb in mysql, I was kind of alarmed that you strongly recommend on using innodb instead of myism.

From what I googled by now, it seems that the performance benefits are related to insertion and deletion (and some extra stability) but is it really noticeable difference on wordpress? 

Maybe I&#039;m just afraid of change.... but since I&#039;m backing up and restoring right now, I don&#039;t want to add some extra work if I don&#039;t have to.]]></description>
