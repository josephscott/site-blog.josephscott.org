I do like the way Opera does the address bar. It&#039;s been my primary browser for probably 7 or 8 years now; I love it. :)]]></description>

That sounds like more work than &quot;^v^&lt;del&gt;&quot; or &quot;s/

Meh. I&#039;ll digress. I dig it.]]></description>

That is the problem, not the solution.   I select &#039;www.google.com&#039; to be copied, but because Chrome and Firefox alter that behavior behind the scenes what actually gets copied is http://www.google.com/.  Meaning the only way for me to copy and paste the host name from the URL field is to copy ww.google.com (note the missing w at the front), then manually type the first letter (w in this case) and then paste.  This completely breaks copy and paste, since the whole premis is that it copies what you have selected, not magical additional parts that aren&#039;t even shown to the user.

I thought I&#039;d made these points pretty clear in this post and in the post I linked to about Chrome doing the same thing.  I&#039;ll try harder to be even clearer though since these points obviously didn&#039;t come through enough.]]></description>

Yeah. That works too. I think displaying &quot;http://&quot;/ at all is still silly, but whatever makes you sleep at night. :)]]></description>

Except, the &quot;http://&quot;/ is in the clipboard object. Try it. Copy a URL, and paste it into a text field. So, copy/paste is not broken.]]></description>

&lt;blockquote&gt;BTW, Opera also has removed ‚Äúhttp://‚Äù/ from the address bar. It seems at this point ,Safari and IE are the only ones holding on to it.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Opera has removed &quot;http://&quot;/ from view while browsing, but retains normal copy/paste by showing it when the URL field is activated. This to me seems to be the best of both worlds.]]></description>

The main problem here, as I mentioned in the original last line of the post &quot;If you want to no longer show ‚Äòhttp://‚Äô/ in the URL field, fine, but please stop breaking copy and paste.&quot; is that they aren&#039;t just removing &#039;http://&/#039; from the URL field.  They are also completely breaking copy and paste in the process.  Saving an extra 6 characters in the URL field at the expense of breaking copy and paste seems like a really bad trade off.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s generally understood that browsers communicate using the HTTP protocol, for those tech-savvy enough to understand what that means. So, showing the information that the browser is still using it, is just overly redundant, and unnecessarily noisy. For those not tech-savvy enough to understand what the HTTP protocol is, or &quot;http://&quot;/ (the vast majority of people), it&#039;s not going to be missed.

Further, because it&#039;s generally understood that browsers use HTTP as their main protocol, it makes sense to display the protocol in the browser, only when using a different protocol, such as HTTPS, FTP, Gopher, etc.

BTW, Opera also has removed &quot;http://&quot;/ from the address bar. It seems at this point ,Safari and IE are the only ones holding on to it.]]></description>
