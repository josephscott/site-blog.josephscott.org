I select 'www.google.com' to be copied, but because Chrome and Firefox alter that behavior behind the scenes what actually gets copied is http://www.google.com/.  Meaning the only way for me to copy and paste the host name from the URL field is to copy ww.google.com (note the missing w at the front), then manually type the first letter (w in this case) and then paste.  This completely breaks copy and paste, since the whole premis is that it copies what you have selected, not magical additional parts that aren't even shown to the user.\n\nI thought I'd made these points pretty clear in this post and in the post I linked to about Chrome doing the same thing.  I'll try harder to be even clearer though since these points obviously didn't come through enough.",
