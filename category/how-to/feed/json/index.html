Here is the situation, a secure (SSL) connection to Apache to an internal website written in PHP talking to a PostgreSQL database with IE 6 on the client end.  The initial version of the reports just displayed in an HTML table as part of the site.  It was suggested that the data should be available as CSV so that employees could easily manipulate or graph the data in Excel.  Sounded reasonable enough.  After a couple of tries it looked like I had everything working.  All of my initial tests were done using Firefox on Windows, with a little bit of testing using Safari on OS X.  I know we still have some folks at work who are still using IE (that too is another story) so I tested that one out last.  Everything worked, right up until I tried to download the CSV version of the reports.</p>\n<p>Instead of prompting me with a dialog box to determine if I wanted to open the file or save, IE simply came back and indicated that it couldn&#8217;t save the file and presented with me with one option, &#8216;OK&#8217;.  Of course &#8216;OK&#8217; isn&#8217;t really &#8216;OK&#8217;, because it terminated the download and dropped me back into the website.

After trying out several ideas over a couple of hours I came across the solution.  Here is what I believe to be the minimum solution to make IE correctly download a file presented to it from PHP.</p>\n<p>First, when talking to IE there is an additional session parameter that must be set for the download to work (this was the last piece of the puzzle that I found).

If that second line matches then the third takes kicks in, which simply redirects the user to the SSL version of your URL.

I wanted to add some of the data they have to our <a href=\"http://www.mrtg.org/\">MRTG</a> graphing (input voltage, output load, temperature, etc) so I started by using <a href=\"http://net-snmp.sourceforge.net/man/snmpwalk.html\">snmpwalk</a> to see what data the Tripp Lite exposed via SNMP.  Unfortunately I didn&#8217;t get MIB text descriptions, just the numbers.  So after looking around for a bit I found the CD that came with the devices, it had some two MIB files, <a href=\"http://www.tripplite.com/software/snmpfw/tripplite.mib\">trpplite.mib</a> and <a href=\"http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc1628.html\">Rfc1628.mib</a>.  I dumped these into /usr/share/snmp/mibs on my PowerBook figuring that snmpwalk would just pick up on the extra MIB information.  That turned out to not be the case.  For some reason snmpwalk has a <a href=\"http://groups.google.com/groups?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;selm=7votf4%241klm%241%40news.net.uni-c.dk\">special option to tell it to use all of the MIB definitions</a>.  Go figure.  After all of this I can now run &#8216;snmpwalk -m ALL -Os -c public -v 1 tripplitehost&#8217; and get back all of the SNMP information available.</p>\n",
