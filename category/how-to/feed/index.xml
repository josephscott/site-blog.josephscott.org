										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was working on some site design and needed to tweak it for IE (IE dev team, hello, is this thing on?  Better CSS support please) in order to make look more along the lines of what I had intended (which is the way that FireFox and Safari display it).  So off to Google I went hoping to find some way to easy include CSS only for IE browsers.  Low and behold it is amazingly easy!  I first came across <a href="http://www.noscope.com/journal/2004/04/conditional_comments">this example</a> which lead me to the <a href="http://www.quirksmode.org/css/condcom.html">conditional comments site</a>.  All I can say is, wow!  It works, it&#8217;s simple, doesn&#8217;t feel like a complete crazy hack (although some might say the mere fact that this has to be done at all is a hack) and it only took me a minute or two to put it all together.</p>
<p>It is a shame that this has to be done, but at least there is an easy way to do it.  Here&#8217;s an example of including CSS that will only be used by Internet Explorer (IE):</p>
<p><code><br />
&lt;!--[if IE]&gt;<br />
&lt;link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" media="screen"<br />
    href="/ie-style.css" /&gt;<br />
&lt;![endif]--&gt;<br />
</code></p>
<p>It seems that you could include any sort of HTML (or JavaScript?) between these conditional comments.</p>

Most of these are things that I usually only often enough that I remember where to look information but not the actual information itself, so these cheat sheets should come in handy.  I recommend using the PDF versions for printing over the PNG versions, I was able to get much better print quality out of the PDFs.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d love to see a few more these for MS SQL server, Oracle, PostgreSQL and Vim.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve been adding more report features to our internal web app at work.  Getting them to the point they are at now is another story, for now let me tell the tale of convincing Internet Explorer (IE) to download a comma separated value (CSV) version of these reports.  Here is the situation, a secure (SSL) connection to Apache to an internal website written in PHP talking to a PostgreSQL database with IE 6 on the client end.  The initial version of the reports just displayed in an HTML table as part of the site.  It was suggested that the data should be available as CSV so that employees could easily manipulate or graph the data in Excel.  Sounded reasonable enough.  After a couple of tries it looked like I had everything working.  All of my initial tests were done using Firefox on Windows, with a little bit of testing using Safari on OS X.  I know we still have some folks at work who are still using IE (that too is another story) so I tested that one out last.  Everything worked, right up until I tried to download the CSV version of the reports.</p>
<p>Instead of prompting me with a dialog box to determine if I wanted to open the file or save, IE simply came back and indicated that it couldn&#8217;t save the file and presented with me with one option, &#8216;OK&#8217;.  Of course &#8216;OK&#8217; isn&#8217;t really &#8216;OK&#8217;, because it terminated the download and dropped me back into the website.  Just great, I thought I was pretty much done and then IE showed its unpleasant side.  Knowing that someone else must have ran into this problem I went on a hunt for a solution.  After trying out several ideas over a couple of hours I came across the solution.  Here is what I believe to be the minimum solution to make IE correctly download a file presented to it from PHP.</p>
<p>First, when talking to IE there is an additional session parameter that must be set for the download to work (this was the last piece of the puzzle that I found).  This has to be done before starting the session.</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
if(strpos($_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT'], 'MSIE')) {
    session_cache_limiter("public");
}
session_start();
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Once you have built your CSV string and are ready to send it to the browser you&#8217;ll need to add a couple of headers first.</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
header('Content-type: application/octet-stream');
header('Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="report.csv"');
print($csv);
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Now that it all seems to be working it doesn&#8217;t look very impressive, but it was certainly disappointing to have my initial solution work in Safari, Firefox and Opera but not IE.  I hope this saves someone else the hours I spent figuring out why IE hates me.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve got a test system at work with a <a href="http://www.promise.com/">Promise</a> ATA RAID controller in it.  When I first put the card and drives in it I used the BIOS on the card to establish a mirror.  This mirror took awhile to do (two 250gig IDE drives), but once it was done it worked fine.  FreeBSD made use of it without any complaints.</p>
<p>Today I thought it would be nice to see how hard it is to rebuild the mirror, so powered off the system and pulled one of the drives.  The BIOS on the card alerted me during boot up that the mirror had an error, but I wanted to be able to still use the system while the mirror was rebuilding (since it takes so long).  That led me to <a href="http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=atacontrol&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=0&amp;manpath=FreeBSD+5.2.1-RELEASE+and+Ports&amp;format=html">atacontrol</a>.  Unfortunately the man page wasn&#8217;t enough for me to figure how to get the mirror to rebuild.</p>
<p>Some more time on Google and I came across post on the FreeBSD -current email list, <a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?q=atacontrol+rebuild,+how&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;group=muc.lists.freebsd.current&amp;c2coff=1&amp;selm=41365CA5.2000300%40cs.unisa.edu.au&amp;rnum=1">Re: atacontrol rebuild, how?</a>.  This post gave me the extra bits of info that I needed to getting the rebuild going:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Perhaps something worth trying is the following &#8211; It&#8217;s what I have to do<br />
to get the promisc card I use to rebuild:</p>
<p>    &#8211; Identify the channel the drive is on (ie ad6 on ata3)</p>
<p>atacontrol detach ata3<br />
atacontrol attach ata3<br />
atacontrol addspare ar0 ad6<br />
atacontrol rebuild</p>
<p>The command exits straight away but if you run: atacontrol status ar0<br />
I get a &#8216;REBUILDING 0%&#8217; message</p>
<p>Also checking the ps output shows a rebuild thread.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;d tried the detach and attach steps before, but hadn&#8217;t tried addspare.  That was the missing step, after that the rebuild started.  It is still going to take a long time, but at least the system is usable while it is rebuilding.  I haven&#8217;t tried it yet, but this should work fine for boot partitions also.  Just remember to properly identify which drive failed <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here is another one of those things that I do often enough to know that there is way to do it, but infrequently enough to forget exactly how to do it.  This time it was remembering how to get a cvs module without all of those CVS directories that are used in working copies of the module.  The command I was looking for is &#8216;cvs export&#8217;, instead of &#8216;cvs checkout&#8217;.  The export command also requires a date or tag to be specified so that the export can be reproduced.  If you aren&#8217;t worried about that and just want an export as of right now you can use NOW as the date.  This would look something like this:</p>
<p>cvs -d /home/cvs export -DNOW mymodule</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="float: left;padding: 10px"></p>
<p></span><br />
There are plenty of times I want to require users to be accessing a site only via SSL.  My first try at this was to simple create a .htaccess file that contained SSLRequireSSL, which basically tells Apache that access to a site can only be allowed if SSL is being used.  This accomplished what I wanted, but it brought a side issue to requiring SSL, users often leave off (or forget) the the s in https.  So after a little bit of digging around I found another approach to this.  The new .htaccess file looks like this:<br />
<code><br />
RewriteEngine On<br />
RewriteCond %{SERVER_PORT} !443<br />
RewriteRule (.*) https://www.example.com/require-secure/ [R]<br />
</code><br />
The first line tells Apache we are going to use mod_rewrite.  The second line only matches if the port being used to access the site is 443 (the port reserved for https use).  If that second line matches then the third takes kicks in, which simply redirects the user to the SSL version of your URL.  This still enforces the use of SSL, but saves you from trying figure why you can&#8217;t get to your site just because you forget the s in https.</p>
<p><b>UPDATE Tue 23 May 2006 @ 3:50pm :</b> <a href="http://joseph.randomnetworks.com/archives/2004/07/22/redirect-to-ssl-using-apaches-htaccess/#comment-477">Comment #4 by Nicolás Echániz</a> has an even better version of this that isn&#8217;t limited to checking a specific port (443) for SSL:</p>
<p><code><br />
RewriteEngine On<br />
RewriteCond %{HTTPS} off<br />
RewriteRule (.*) https://%{HTTP_HOST}%{REQUEST_URI}/<br />
</code></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At work we&#8217;ve got some <a href="http://www.tripplite.com/">Tripp Lite</a> battery backups.  I wanted to add some of the data they have to our <a href="http://www.mrtg.org/">MRTG</a> graphing (input voltage, output load, temperature, etc) so I started by using <a href="http://net-snmp.sourceforge.net/man/snmpwalk.html">snmpwalk</a> to see what data the Tripp Lite exposed via SNMP.  Unfortunately I didn&#8217;t get MIB text descriptions, just the numbers.  So after looking around for a bit I found the CD that came with the devices, it had some two MIB files, <a href="http://www.tripplite.com/software/snmpfw/tripplite.mib">trpplite.mib</a> and <a href="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc1628.html">Rfc1628.mib</a>.  I dumped these into /usr/share/snmp/mibs on my PowerBook figuring that snmpwalk would just pick up on the extra MIB information.  That turned out to not be the case.  For some reason snmpwalk has a <a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;selm=7votf4%241klm%241%40news.net.uni-c.dk">special option to tell it to use all of the MIB definitions</a>.  Go figure.  After all of this I can now run &#8216;snmpwalk -m ALL -Os -c public -v 1 tripplitehost&#8217; and get back all of the SNMP information available.</p>
