										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was working on some site design and needed to tweak it for IE (IE dev team, hello, is this thing on?  Better CSS support please) in order to make look more along the lines of what I had intended (which is the way that FireFox and Safari display it).  So off to Google I went hoping to find some way to easy include CSS only for IE browsers.  Low and behold it is amazingly easy!  I first came across <a href="http://www.noscope.com/journal/2004/04/conditional_comments">this example</a> which lead me to the <a href="http://www.quirksmode.org/css/condcom.html">conditional comments site</a>.  All I can say is, wow!  It works, it&#8217;s simple, doesn&#8217;t feel like a complete crazy hack (although some might say the mere fact that this has to be done at all is a hack) and it only took me a minute or two to put it all together.</p>
<p>It is a shame that this has to be done, but at least there is an easy way to do it.  Here&#8217;s an example of including CSS that will only be used by Internet Explorer (IE):</p>
<p><code><br />
&lt;!--[if IE]&gt;<br />
&lt;link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" media="screen"<br />
    href="/ie-style.css" /&gt;<br />
&lt;![endif]--&gt;<br />
</code></p>
<p>It seems that you could include any sort of HTML (or JavaScript?) between these conditional comments.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yes, my wish has come true (at least in part).  Someone has put together an <a href="http://www.broken-notebook.com/spell.php">AJAX spell checker for forms</a>.  There doesn&#8217;t seem to be a specific license included, but hopefully that will get worked out and projects will start making use of this.  I&#8217;ve been spoiled by having the ability to spell check form fields in Mac OS X, having this feature on the website itself would make using Windows less painful.</p>
<p>Yes, I know, <a href="http://www.gmail.com/">Gmail</a> already does this, but I want to see it spread into other projects.  Anything where you type significant amount of text should seriously be looking into this.  Along with the ability (should be a requirement I think) to do comment previews in <a href="http://www.wordpress.org/">WordPress</a>, spell checking the comments comes in as a close second on my wish list.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/marc/">Marc</a> complains about the <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2005/05/atom_has_a_bran.html">branding confusion for feeds</a>.  When O&#8217;Reilly decided to only support ATOM feeds they kept getting requests for RSS feeds, not because people were so up in arms that O&#8217;Reilly wasn&#8217;t supporting their preferred format, but because they didn&#8217;t realize that the information they wanted was already available as a feed.  I think Marc is right, ATOM suffers from an awareness problem.  For better or for worse many people (especially the less technical) equate RSS with a feed and vis-versa.  So for these folks, if you don&#8217;t have those three letters (RSS) on your feed then you don&#8217;t have a feed.</p>
<p>The solution that O&#8217;Reilly has decided to take for this awareness problem is to more or less revert back a few years and start plastering those ugly little RSS icons in place of the currently less ugly ATOM icons.  They aren&#8217;t going to make it overly obvious what format the feed is in, this is a good idea.  What I&#8217;d like to see if for the feed links to be a bit more descriptive, like &#8220;blog post feed&#8221; or &#8220;blog comment feed&#8221; or &#8220;comments on this post feed&#8221;.  One of the things that has annoyed with how many sites describe feeds is that they don&#8217;t really describe they at all, instead relying on the format they use as their only meaningful description.  There are so many different bits of information that are made available via feeds now it simply isn&#8217;t good enough to simply go hey, here&#8217;s my feed.  Users need to know what data is included in the feed.</p>
<p>Personally I&#8217;d love to see this whole feed format terminology more or less go away.  The bulk of the public doesn&#8217;t care if you are using HTML or XHTML for your website, or which version of each, they simply want to know where your website is at.  So let&#8217;s get people asking where your feeds are like they ask for your email address (for which they also don&#8217;t care if you use MS Exchange, Sendmail, Postfix, Qmail or Exim) and your website.</p>

Most of these are things that I usually only often enough that I remember where to look information but not the actual information itself, so these cheat sheets should come in handy.  I recommend using the PDF versions for printing over the PNG versions, I was able to get much better print quality out of the PDFs.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d love to see a few more these for MS SQL server, Oracle, PostgreSQL and Vim.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It really is amazing how many things <a href="http://www.google.com/">Google</a> manages to duplicate from others, but usually better than what was already being done.  Today they <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2005/05/method-to-our-madness.html">announced</a> another new feature, the ability to personalize your Google page.  It is no surprise that many people have decided that this is an attempt by Google to replicate <a href="http://my.yahoo.com/">My Yahoo</a> to some degree.  JeremY! seems a bit <a href="http://jeremy.zawodny.com/blog/archives/004684.html">perturbed about Google becoming a portal</a>.  That&#8217;s understandable, Google often snubs the way Yahoo has become a media portal.</p>
<p>I think all of these comparisons are off the mark, after using the personalized Google page it feels a lot more like <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/dashboard/">Dashboard on Mac OS X</a> than My Yahoo.  I realize it isn&#8217;t fundamentally different from My Yahoo, but each little block feels more like <a href="http://www.apple.com/downloads/macosx/dashboard/">Dashboard Widgets</a>.  Most of this probably comes from the ability to drag and drop gidgets (Google Widgets?) to change their layout on the page.  Editing each gidget is done right on the page instead of going to different page.  All of this smacks of Dashboard, not My Yahoo.</p>
<p>Ah, I guess I should link to the <a href="http://www.google.com/ig">personalized Google page</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s official now, Google has put their <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2005/05/feed-me.html">AdSense for Feeds into beta</a>.  They&#8217;ve got a <a href="https://www.google.com/support/adsense/bin/answer.py?answer=20012">FAQ about it</a>, a brief &#8220;<a href="http://www.google.com/support/adsense/bin/answer.py?answer=20134">best practices</a>&#8221; article and an <a href="http://services.google.com/ads_inquiry/aff">application to sign up</a>.</p>
<p>There will undoubtedly still be those who thing that this is just the worst thing to happen since the dawn of time.  I think this is more or less a natural progression.  Just like many in the entertainment industry (music, movies, tv, radio, etc) didn&#8217;t (or chose not to) see the future coming and find ways to make it work for them, those who fight against this idea are in for a long loosing battle.  Instead of trying to fight it the better road is find ways to make it work for everyone (see iTunes).</p>
<p>The writing is on the wall, ads in feeds are here, get used to it or get out out of the way.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m trying out <a href="http://wiki.splitbrain.org/wiki:dokuwiki">DokuWiki</a> for personal use.  It uses plain files for storage instead of a database and was pretty easy to setup.  Unfortunately wiki software packages are much like email clients, they all of issues and problems, you just have decided which problems you are willing to deal with.  I&#8217;m not committed to DokuWiki, so if I find something else that better fits my needs I&#8217;ll be happy to change.</p>
<p>I was rather disappointed at the state of wiki software in general.  There were several features that few (and in many cases none that I could find) that had some of the more interesting and useful features, especially for business environments.  Here&#8217;s a short (probably incomplete) wish list:</p>
<ul>
<li>ACLs: More packages are supporting this now, I&#8217;m still surprised that more don&#8217;t have it though.  This implies authentication, which needs to support several different methods (Database, LDAP, PAM?).</li>
<li>Hierarchy: Name spaces are great, but I&#8217;d really like to see the ability to structure wiki pages.  I suspect this one will be more difficult that some of the other features.  My wiki should able to generate a sitemap for me.</li>
<li>Tags: You&#8217;d think with <a href="http://www.flickr.com/">Flickr</a> and <a href="http://del.icio.us/">del.icio.us</a> taking off, people would be all over this.  And no, I don&#8217;t think that having tags means not having a hierarchy, they should complement each other, not replace each other.</li>
<li>Page Copy/Clone: I&#8217;d like to be able to start a new page as a copy of existing page (with a new title, link, etc) that optionally carries over all of the history of the page being copied.  The new page should have some way of linking back to the page that it was copied from.  Each source page should also be able to link to all pages that started as copies of it.</li>
<li>Page Templates: This sort of similar to the idea of Page Copy/Clone, but with a twist.  I&#8217;d like to be to create templates, that aren&#8217;t really meant to be used as pages themselves (ACLs to prevent others from changing them?), but simply as a starting point for a new page.  So when creating a new page you get the option of using one of a list of existing templates in the system.  This could get tricky fast, for instance, if you update a template does it try to update all of the pages that used that template?  Hey, I didn&#8217;t say all of this would be easy.</li>
<li>TrackBacks: Crossing over a bit into the world of blogs, every page on a wiki should have trackback support for other sites that link to it.  This can get complicated also, what do you do when your ACL doesn&#8217;t allow for public viewing of that page?  How do you prevent TrackBack spam?</li>
<li>Page Comments: While your first thought might be that this is another blog cross over, it isn&#8217;t.  This stems more from seeing the success of page comments in the <a href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/">PHP documentation</a>.  I would like to see a more complex set of comment options though (threaded, ability to sort on different attributes like date, etc).  More avenues for comment spam, would be less of an issue if ACLs required an account to comment on a page.</li>
<li>Export: You should be able to export the wiki in part or in whole in a some reasonable format (XML?).  Difference in syntax formatting would be a problem.</li>
<li>Fine Grained RSS: Many wiki packages support RSS, but with varying degrees of granularity.  I&#8217;d like to be able to subscribe to wiki wide changes, page changes, wiki wide comments, page comments and the various variations you&#8217;d be likely to thing of.  Perhaps all of the changes and comments for pages with the tag of joseph, or all changes and comments in a given namespace or hierarchy, with the option of being recursive.</li>
<li>Wiki Wide Point In Time: Show the whole wiki how it looked at a given date and time.  Along with that I&#8217;d like to be able to some sort of diff or changelog given two different date and times.  This could potentially blow up into a huge feature, show me all the pages that were added between 1 Jan 2004 and 1 Jan 2005.  Show me all of the comments that were added between 1 Mar 2005 and 1 Apr 2005.  Show me all of the trackbacks added between 1 Apr 2005 and 1 May 2005.  You should be able to specify this down to the second (1 May 2005 @ 08:14:33am PST).  I think you get the idea.
</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#8217;m sure there are plenty more, but this should be enough to keep most folks busy.  Some wiki packages do implement some of these features, but I haven&#8217;t found one that implements all of them and certainly not to the degree that I&#8217;m looking for.  A lot of these features stem from wanting to use a wiki in a business environment more than just for personal use.</p>
<p>It would be interesting to start a wiki project with these sorts of goals, but I doubt I&#8217;d ever have the time.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Being able to link to other pages on the web is one of the things that makes the web work.  Citing where the page where your found a link is something of a sub-trend with the explosion of blogging.  I&#8217;ve done this myself, giving a link and then mentioning that I came across it via another site.  While I generally refer to this as via, but others (like <a href="http://www.photomatt.net/">PhotoMatt</a>) use the term hat tip.  Either the idea is the same, to indicate were we came across the link.  Unfortunately all of this is rather free form, it is easy enough for people to parse this and see the relationship, but there is nothing beyond that indicate that there is a relationship between the two links.  What we really need is a way in markup to show the relationship.</p>
<p>Ryan King has a <a href="http://theryanking.com/blog/archives/2005/05/06/hvia/">few ideas</a> on how to deal with this.  He&#8217;s referring to this problem as &#8220;hVia&#8221;.  Go read his write up and on this and come back.  Alright, lets see if I can&#8217;t take this a step further.</p>
<p>The problem is that we want to indicate how we discovered the page that we are linking to.  There are several ways that we may want to describe how we got this URL.  Ryan uses an example from PhotoMatt about getting a URL via email.  Unfortunately in Ryan&#8217;s example that information isn&#8217;t really encoded in a meaningful way.  It does help style the text a bit, but doesn&#8217;t help us scrape this information and come up a meaningful array of data.  So how about we spell out what want out of a good solution:</p>
<ol>
<li>Markup that is easily parsed by computers</li>
<li>Rendered in a way that is meaningful to people</li>
<li>Allows for multiple types of references, examples would be (but not necessarily limited to):
<ul>
<li>Another URL</li>
<li>Email</li>
<li>IM/IRC</li>
<li>In Person</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Easy to style with CSS</li>
</ol>
<p>With all this in mind I&#8217;m going to through out a couple of possibilities.  Think of these as part of a brain storming session as opposed to firm suggestions as to the &#8220;right way&#8221; to do this.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Cite and ID</strong><br />
Add a unique id attribute to your link and use in the cite tag as a reference.  Something like this:</p>
<p>
&lt;a id=&#8221;unique_ref_id&#8221; href=&#8221;http://www.example.com/&#8221;&gt;Neat Web Site&lt;/a&gt;<br />
via &lt;cite refid=&#8221;unique_ref_id&#8221;&gt;Email from Bob&lt;/cite&gt;
</p>
<p>This meets most of our qualifications: it is no more complex than parsing existing (X)HTML, allows text to flow nicely for human readers, could be used for any type of reference (albeit in a free form manner) and allows for easy styling.  The weakest part of this format is that the type of reference isn&#8217;t spelled out, so parsers would have to try to make intelligent guesses about what the reference description is.
</li>
<li><strong>Cite, ID and Type</strong><br />
One way to improve upon the first method is to explicitly state why type of reference we are citing.  Something like this:</p>
<p>
&lt;a id=&#8221;unique_ref_id&#8221; href=&#8221;http://www.example.com/&#8221;&gt;Neat Web Site&lt;/a&gt;<br />
via &lt;cite refid=&#8221;unique_ref_id&#8221;  type=&#8221;email&#8221;&gt;Email from Bob&lt;/cite&gt;
</p>
<p>The only addition is the type element to the cite tag, which states outright how we were informed about the link.  In addition to email we could have used any of the types listed above.  With this hint, the data marked up with the cite tag could be treated in a semi-intelligent way.  If the type was a URL then we could aggregate that data and follow propagation of links to a site and who was most referenced.
</li>
</ol>
<p>It&#8217;s getting late some I&#8217;m going to wrap this up for now.  Hopefully this gives folks something to think about.  I&#8217;d like to see more discussion about how do this successfully, so that all of our goals are met.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE 1:20am 7 May 2005</strong>: I forgot to mention, this is one of the complaints I have about <a href="http://del.icio.us/">del.icio.us</a>, when adding a bookmark you should be able to enter a via reference.  If there is going to be a serious discussion about how to deal with via references, then del.icio.us should at least be a consideration.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Not to be left out, <a href="http://news.com.com/AOL+offers+free+blog+services+to+general+public/2100-1038_3-5697824.html?part=rss&amp;tag=5697824&amp;subj=news">AOL is offering free blogs</a>.  If you have an AIM screen name you can create one in just a couple of steps.  The process reminded me a lot of the steps to create an account on <a href="http://spaces.msn.com/">MSN Spaces</a>.</p>
<p>All of these free blog services remind me of all of the old free web site providers that used to be around.  This certainly seems like the next logical step, most people would sign up for a free website and do nothing with it.  Now they can sign up for a free blog and do nothing with it <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
