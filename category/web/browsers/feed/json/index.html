Getting them to the point they are at now is another story, for now let me tell the tale of convincing Internet Explorer (IE) to download a comma separated value (CSV) version of these reports.  Here is the situation, a secure (SSL) connection to Apache to an internal website written in PHP talking to a PostgreSQL database with IE 6 on the client end.  The initial version of the reports just displayed in an HTML table as part of the site.  It was suggested that the data should be available as CSV so that employees could easily manipulate or graph the data in Excel.  Sounded reasonable enough.  After a couple of tries it looked like I had everything working.  All of my initial tests were done using Firefox on Windows, with a little bit of testing using Safari on OS X.  I know we still have some folks at work who are still using IE (that too is another story) so I tested that one out last.  Everything worked, right up until I tried to download the CSV version of the reports.</p>\n<p>Instead of prompting me with a dialog box to determine if I wanted to open the file or save, IE simply came back and indicated that it couldn&#8217;t save the file and presented with me with one option, &#8216;OK&#8217;.  Of course &#8216;OK&#8217; isn&#8217;t really &#8216;OK&#8217;, because it terminated the download and dropped me back into the website.
