										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Caching is one of the techniques used in software and hardware to make things faster.  We usually like things to be fast, so we are usually happy to use systems that cache in a variety of ways.  Let&#8217;s face it, everybody caches.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve been living on this planet for awhile now you&#8217;ll recognize that it is pretty rare that you get something for nothing.  It&#8217;s no different with caching.  The OS on your computer caches reads and writes to your hard drive, and from time to time will flush that cache out to disk.  It&#8217;s important that this flush happens so that when you loose power your data is on the hard drive, not memory.  Except that everybody caches, this includes your hard drives.  So when your OS goes to flush data to the disk, the disk caches it in its own memory and eventually flushes to the actual disk portion of the drive.  Once again this is all down in the name of speed.  And once again the biggest risk of this is loss of data when the power goes out.  You want to note that this is why many RAID controllers will often have a small battery to keep that data they&#8217;ve cached in memory still there for a day or two, by which time we hope the power will have been restored.</p>
<p>Hopefully none of the above is news, this has been the situation for computers and hard drives for years.  It is news for at least some folks though, other wise the <a href="http://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</a> crowd wouldn&#8217;t be so surprised that <a href="http://hardware.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/05/13/0529252&amp;tid=198&amp;tid=128">your hard drive lies to you</a>.  This discussion seems to have been touched off by a <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/~brad/2116715.html">tool that demos your hard drive caching</a> and how you can turn it off in Linux.  Brad wrote this tool as a result of <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/community/lj_dev/670215.html">LiveJournal&#8217;s outage</a>, where data loss do to drive write caching seems to have been a pretty major problem for them.  Not long after LJs problems <a href="http://news.netcraft.com/archives/2005/02/22/power_outage_knocks_wikipedia_offline.html">Wikipedia was offline for the same reason</a>.</p>
<p>Some of the comments on the Slashdot article about hard drives caching did provide good information.  One <a href="http://hardware.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=149349&amp;cid=12517596">comment pointed out caching issues mentioned on various man pages</a> from Mac OS X, Linux and FreeBSD.  This comment was interesting because it references another point in time where there was a lot of discussion about what do with hard drive caching and the risks there of.  The FreeBSD man page quoted in the comment references FreeBSD 4.3, which was <a href="http://www.freebsd.org/releases/">released four years ago</a>.  I remember the huge discussion that broke out about disabling hard drive caching in FreeBSD.  Many argued that the risks of data of loss were just too great, but in the end the huge performance loss when turning off the hard drive caching was just too much bare.</p>
<p>Thankfully another comment also pointed to an <a href="http://lists.apple.com/archives/darwin-dev/2005/Feb/msg00072.html">Apple email about hard drive caching</a>.  If you deal with file storage go read that, it is very informative.  The lesson learned is that for plain average systems with off the shelf hard drives, you may or may not be able to convince your hard drive to put data on to the disk manually.</p>
<p>Just remember, everybody caches, so plan accordingly.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Just in case you don&#8217;t follow the <a href="http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1">BugTraq email list</a> there has been discussion over the last couple of days about an <a href="http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/371441/2004-08-09/2004-08-15/0">interesting bug</a> in <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/">Microsoft Windows</a> and or <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/ie/">Internet Explorer</a>.  A demo of bug has been posted at <a href="http://www.geocities.com/visitbipin/crazy.html">http://www.geocities.com/visitbipin/crazy.html</a>.  BE WARNED, viewing that site in IE on a Windows box will cause it to lock up and reboot!  Just for kicks I tried on my Windows XP box and it caused it to be rebooted when I viewed it with IE.  When Windows came back up it reported an error with the NVidia GForce 2 video drivers.  The good news is that if you view the site using <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/">Firefox</a> on Windows your system will slow down to a crawl, but you can still use the task manager to kill Firefox, bringing everything back to normal.  No such luck in IE.  If I really wanted to rub it in I&#8217;d mention that viewing the site with <a href="http://www.apple.com/safari/">Safari</a> on <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/">Mac OS X</a> does nothing but take a little while to download, no crushing load or reboot in site.  That would probably be too much though, so we&#8217;ll just keep that to ourselves.</p>
<p>Triggering this bug is remarkably easy, looks like at that is needed is to include an image tag that has the width and height specified as 9999999 each.  I&#8217;d suppose that any image could be used for this.  I was able to make it work with an html file that only contained the following line:</p>
<p>&lt;img width=9999999 height=9999999 src=&#8221;crazy.jpg&#8221; &gt;</p>
<p>The first mention of this that I noticed was the BugTraq post which happened on 11 Aug 2004.  I realize that Microsoft is likely very busy right now trying to get XP SP2 out the door, but this bug should get some attention.  Hmmmm, if you could combine this with a <a href="http://www.cgisecurity.com/articles/xss-faq.shtml">Cross Site Scripting (XSS)</a> attack this could get really interesting.</p>
<p>&lt;star wars&gt;<br />
I felt a great disturbance in the net, as if millions of Windows systems suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly rebooted.<br />
&lt;/star wars&gt;</p>
<p><strong>Update (11:18 am 12 Aug 2004)</strong>: I just finished installing SP2 for Windows XP and IE no longer crashes with this bug.</p>
<p><strong>Update (11:45 am 12 Aug 2004)</strong>: This also does not work on a laptop I tried it on.  It has an ATI video card.  It did make the system extremely slow but it was still able to kill IE via the task manager.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>UPDATE Tue 8 Nov 2005 4:05pm</strong>: If you are interested in using Active Directory users and groups on FreeBSD please read the updated version of this post: <a href="http://joseph.randomnetworks.com/archives/2005/11/08/freebsd-users-and-groups-with-samba-winbind-and-active-directory/">FreeBSD Users and Groups with Samba (Winbind) and Active Directory</a>.  This updated version doesn&#8217;t have the LDAP requirements that his how to does.</p>
<hr />
<p>Back in January of I had <a href="http://www.randomnetworks.com/joseph/blog/?eid=71">mentioned using SFU with nss_ldap on FreeBSD</a> on my old blog.  Now that I&#8217;ve got a couple of <a href="http://joseph.randomnetworks.com/archives/2004/06/16/software-for-a-new-windows-2000-server/">fresh Windows 2000 servers</a> with Active Directory and SFU (<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/sfu/default.asp">Windows Services For Unix</a>) I figured now was a good time to write a howto on making FreeBSD use <a href="http://www.padl.com/OSS/nss_ldap.html">nss_ldap</a> and <a href="http://www.padl.com/OSS/pam_ldap.html">pam_ldap</a> in conjunction with Active Directory.  I&#8217;m using Windows 2000, SFU 3.5, FreeBSD 5.2.1-RELEASE, nss_ldap 1.204_5 and pam_ldap 1.6.9 for this write up.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Windows</strong>: Have Active Directory up and running.  If you are starting from scratch you may want to look at my <a href="http://joseph.randomnetworks.com/archives/2004/06/16/software-for-a-new-windows-2000-server/">entry on installing a new Windows 2000 server</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Windows</strong>: Have SFU installed, specifically &#8216;Server for NIS&#8217;.  Installing that will alter the Active Directory LDAP schema and add a &#8216;Unix Attributes&#8217; tab to the user properties window.</li>
<li><strong>Windows</strong>: Add unix attributes to groups and users that you need to use via nss_ldap.</li>
<li><strong>FreeBSD</strong>: Install <code>net/nss_ldap</code> and <code>security/pam_ldap</code> from the FreeBSD ports collection.</li>
<li><strong>FreeBSD</strong>: Create the file <code>/usr/local/etc/ldap.conf</code>, add the following (using your own info instead of the example.com info):
<pre>
uri ldap://yourldapserver.example.com/
base dc=example,dc=com
ldap_version 3
binddn administrator@example.com
bindpw AdminPasswordHere
scope sub
pam_login_attribute msSFU30Name
pam_password ad
nss_base_passwd cn=users,dc=example,dc=com?one
nss_base_group cn=users,dc=example,dc=com?one
nss_map_objectclass posixAccount User
nss_map_attribute uid msSFU30Name
nss_map_attribute uidNumber msSFU30UidNumber
nss_map_attribute gidNumber msSFU30GidNumber
nss_map_attribute loginShell msSFU30LoginShell
nss_map_attribute gecos name
nss_map_attribute userPassword msSFU30Password
nss_map_attribute homeDirectory msSFU30HomeDirectory
nss_map_objectclass posixGroup Group
nss_map_attribute uniqueMember posixMember
nss_map_attribute cn sAMAccountName
</pre>
</li>
<li><strong>FreeBSD</strong>: Restrict access to <code>/usr/local/etc/ldap.conf</code> with <code>chmod 400 ldap.conf</code>.
</li>
<li><strong>FreeBSD</strong>: Create a symlink for <code>/usr/local/etc/nss_ldap.conf</code> pointing to <code>/usr/local/etc/ldap.conf</code> (ln -s ldap.conf nss_ldap.conf).  You can use two different config files, but in this example I&#8217;m putting everything in one file.
</li>
<li><strong>FreeBSD</strong>: Create the file <code>/etc/nsswitch.conf</code>, add the following:
<pre>
passwd: files ldap
group: files ldap
</pre>
</li>
<li><strong>FreeBSD</strong>: In <code>/etc/pam.d</code> add the following line to the service files (in the auth section of each file) that will need to use ldap authentication, likely targets would include <code>sshd</code>, <code>imap</code>, <code>ftpd</code> and <code>other</code>.
<pre>
auth            sufficient      /usr/local/lib/pam_ldap.so
</pre>
</li>
</ol>
<p>That&#8217;s it, at this point your FreeBSD system should know about Active Directory users and groups and also authenticate those users against Active Directory.  You can test it by using <code>finger</code> or <code>id</code> for an Active Directory user that has unix attributes.  Remember to include an auth line for pam_ldap in every service that will need to authenticate users.</p>
<p>Even though everything works at this point, there are still a couple of things to be aware of.  First off, all of the ldap traffic is in the clear on the network.  Wrapping up all of that traffic in SSL would be a good idea.  There are a couple of different ways to do that, that will have to wait for another post though.  Also, there are no home directories created for users.  If you expect an Active Directory user to ssh into your FreeBSD box then you&#8217;ll want to create their home directory and give it correct permissions.  There are a couple of pam modules floating around that support automatic creation of home directories, but as far as I know they haven&#8217;t been ported to FreeBSD (see <a href="http://keutel.de/pam_mkhomedir/">pam_mkhomedir for Solaris</a> and <a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/libs/pam/">Linux-PAM</a> which has a linux version of pam_mkhomedir).  Leave a comment if you find (or do it yourself) a pam_mkhomedir that works with FreeBSD, I&#8217;ll be happy to include it in this howto.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At work I&#8217;m putting together a couple of fresh <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows2000/">Windows 2000</a> servers, mostly just to be fancy ldap servers, but that&#8217;s another story.  I wanted to note what software (and version as of this writing) I&#8217;m installing so that I&#8217;ll have it around if I ever (please NO!) have to do this again.</p>
<ol>
<li>During the Windows install
<ul>
<li>Included DNS, Internet Authentication Service (radius support) and WINS under &#8216;Networking Services&#8217;.</li>
<li>Included Print Services for Unix under &#8216;Other Network File and Print Services&#8217;.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Go through <a href="http://www.windowsupdate.com/">Windows Update</a> madness.  It&#8217;s no fun, takes forever, but you&#8217;ve got to do it.  Now that I&#8217;m thinking about it, why isn&#8217;t there an option for your windows box to email you when it has downloaded a new critical update?</li>
<li>Anti-Virus Software.  At work we&#8217;ve purchased <a href="http://www.mcafee.com/">McAfee</a>.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/">Firefox</a> version 0.9.  <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/ie/default.mspx">IE</a> is really only good for the Windows Update service, after that it is Firefox all the way.</li>
<li>SSH Client.  There are a couple of different options, since we are attached to CSU Sacramento I&#8217;ve been using <a href="http://www.ssh.com/">SSH Communications</a> ssh client under their non-commercial license.  Looks like licensing may have changed for version 4 of their product, so were are sticking with <a href="ftp://ftp.ssh.com/pub/ssh/SSHSecureShellClient-3.2.9.exe">version 3.2.9</a>.  There are other Windows ssh clients out there, <a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/">Putty</a> is probably the next in line.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.winzip.com/">WinZip</a>.  Work purchased licenses ages ago, so I&#8217;ve been using that version, 8.0.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.tightvnc.org/">TightVNC</a> for remote admin.  I&#8217;m even living on the edge by using version 1.3-dev5 with the DFMirage driver.</li>
<li>Optional: Install Active Directory if this server is going to hold domain user accounts.  With this particular install that is the case.
<ul>
<li>I selected &#8216;Permissions compatible with pre-Windows 2000 servers&#8217; on the permissions screen in the wizard.  I believe this makes life a little easier when getting <a href="http://www.samba.org/">Samba</a> to play nice with Active Directory.  It&#8217;s also the default option.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Optional: Install <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/sfu/default.asp">Windows Services for Unix</a> version 3.5.  There are all softs of goodies in here.  In my case the only part that I&#8217;m interested in is the &#8216;Server for NIS&#8217; because that extends the Active Directory ldap schema for users.  That allows me to use things like <a href="http://www.padl.com/OSS/nss_ldap.html">nss_ldap</a> on un*x boxes.
<ul>
<li>To just get &#8216;Server for NIS&#8217;, do a customer install of SFU and make sure that everything is deselected (X&#8217;ed out) except for &#8216;Server for NIS&#8217;.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>As I mentioned, these Windows servers will just be storing user accounts so I&#8217;ve kept everything to a minimum.  Ideally I&#8217;d like to have all of our users accounts stored on a unix box somewhere, but to make all of the Windows client systems and servers happy, having a &#8216;real&#8217; Windows server seems to be the only way.  Don&#8217;t get me wrong, Samba has come a long way, and I&#8217;ll continue to use it, just not for holding domain user accounts.  In the end the most important goal is now able to be meet: keeping one set of user and group accounts.  With NSS support in FreeBSD 5.x making use of those accounts is now possible, thanks to nss_ldap and pam_ldap.</p>
