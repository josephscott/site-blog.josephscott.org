<p>The picture is from the Bee&#8217;s article.  If you look closely at the background, just right of center, you will see a young man with a white shirt and suit.  He is a friend of mine, Brian Pebbles.  Fun to see a picture of him and President Hinckley in the paper.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Just as I <a href="http://joseph.randomnetworks.com/archives/2004/08/15/sacramento-temple-ground-breaking/">mentioned last week</a>, this afternoon was the ground breaking ceremony for the Sacramento Temple.  Yesterday there was an <a href="http://www.sacbee.com/content/news/religion/story/10441279p-11360737c.html">article in the Sacramento Bee</a> about the <a href="http://www.lds.org/">LDS</a> church in Sacramento.  We watched the ground breaking via the broadcast to the church buildings in the area.  Our meeting house was packed, there must have been close to 3000 people there I would guess.  It is hoped that the temple will be completed in 18 to 20 months, so around March 2006 or there about.</p>
