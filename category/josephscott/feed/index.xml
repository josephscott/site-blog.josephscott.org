As part of the announcement today for buying <a href="http://polldaddy.com/">PollDaddy</a> there&#8217;s a new <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/polldaddy/">PollDaddy plugin for WordPress</a> and <a href="http://en.blog.wordpress.com/2008/10/15/polldaddy/">integration for WordPress.com blogs</a>.

<p>I&#8217;ve had the opportunity to meet Lenny and Eoin while hanging out with the rest of the Automattic crew (which includes the Intense Debate guys) in Colorado.  It&#8217;s been good to get to meet more of the Automattic group as it continues to grow.  Most of Automattic (all the ones in Colorado) are <a href="http://en.blog.wordpress.com/2008/10/15/polldaddy/">pictured at the bottom of this post</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://utah.wordcamp.org/">WordCamp Utah</a> was on Saturday and nothing exploded, so were calling it a success!  Another round of applause for our <a href="http://utah.wordcamp.org/sponsors/">sponsors</a> that helped make it possible:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://automattic.com/">Automattic</a></li>
<li><a href="http://novell.com/startup">Novell &#8211; OSTC</a></li>
<li><a href="http://crowdfavorite.com/">Crowd Favorite</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.bluehost.com/">Bluehost</a></li>
<li><a href="http://web.twelvehorses.com/">Twelve Horses</a></li>
<li><a href="http://jakespurlock.com/">Jake Spurlock</a></li>
</ul>
<p>And a big thank you for everyone that came to the event.  Our estimated attendance was 135 people.  This number might be a little bit low, it&#8217;s our best estimate at this point.</p>
<p>With the big day having come and gone, I&#8217;ve been thinking about what thinks went well and what I might have done differently.  The scheduled probably should have just included 10 (15?) minute breaks between each session.  Balancing between developer desires and user desires was still a big issue, going with multiple tracks would have helped that I think.</p>
<p>On the plus side doing things through EventBrite and Paypal was good.  Lunch worked out well (I really wanted to make sure no one felt like they didn&#8217;t get enough food), especially having it served by the folks doing the catering (<a href="http://www.the-smokehouse.com/">The Smokehouse</a>).  Having key specific things handled by volunteers, like registration (thanks Clint, Sheri &amp; Shauna!) was a huge help.</p>
<p>What about you?  If you were at WordCamp Utah what did you think went well and what could be improved upon?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.qwest.com/">Qwest</a> has started redirecting DNS queries to their own servers.  Not because I asked them to, they did it to start pushing their own search results page when DNS queries failed (like so many others have and some still do).  This new &#8220;service&#8221; is called <a href="http://www.qwest.net/web.help/">Web.Help</a>.  In order to do this they reset my DSL line this morning (which was irritating), but they did at least provide some links on what this.</p>
<p>After reading through some of their information on their new &#8220;service&#8221; I found a link indicating that I could opt out (not that I ever opted in).  I&#8217;m not sure what they were thinking here though, instead of the &#8220;opt out&#8221; taking me to a page where I could opt out, it took me to another documentation page on their new service.  I had to dig through three or four layers of &#8220;opt out&#8221; links before I got to a page that would actually turn this off.  Which of course reset my DSL connection again about 5 minutes later.  We&#8217;ll see where this ends up.</p>
<p>The search results they were showing for failed DNS queries were from <a href="http://yahoo.com/">Yahoo</a>.  I wonder if Yahoo is paying Qwest to do this.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Just for kicks I was checking out the <a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details/joseph.randomnetworks.com">Alexa traffic stats for joseph.randomnetworks.com</a>.  They let you compare your stats against other sites, so I started looking at how my stats compared to a few others.  Most of them easily eclipsed my numbers.  Then I compared it to <a href="http://ma.tt/">ma.tt</a>:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/josephscott/2852911217/" title="Alexa Traffic by josephscott, on Flickr"><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3158/2852911217_5ea5e25952.jpg" width="444" height="500" alt="Alexa Traffic" /></a></p>
<p>I&#8217;d always had a healthy level of skepticism about how accurate Alexa was.  Once I saw this graph any hope of usefulness that Alexa may have had  was completely gone.  I know for a certainty that not only does  ma.tt get more traffic that this site does, it gets a ton more traffic that I do.</p>
<p>The level of disinformation that Alexa is providing has gone from being just useless to actively harmful.  So remember, friends don&#8217;t let friends rely on Alexa traffic statistics.  For anything.</p>
