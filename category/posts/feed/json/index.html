First, I&#8217;m going to remove Yahoo ( Oath? ).  Next, I&#8217;m adding Amazon and Netflix.\nThe revenue/profit will be for calendar year 2017, with the exceptions of Microsoft ( 30 Jun 2017 ) and Apple ( 30 Sep 2017 ).  The numbers are pulled from the Yahoo ( Oath? ) Finance pages: &#8220;Total Revenue&#8221; and &#8220;Net Income&#8221;.\n\nTotal Employees\nTwitter: 3,400\nNetflix: 4,800\nFacebook: 27,742\nGoogle: 80,110\nApple: 100,000\nMicrosoft: 124,000\nAmazon: 566,000\n\nRevenue Per Employee\nAmazon: $314,250 ( $177,866,000,000 / 566,000 )\nTwitter: $718,617 ( $2,443,299,000 / 3,400 )\nMicrosoft: $725,403 ( $89,950,000,000 / 124,000 )\nGoogle: $1,383,784 ( $110,855,000,000 / 80,110 )\nFacebook: $1,465,395 ( $40,653,000,000 / 27,742 )\nApple: $2,292,340 ( $229,234,000,000 / 100,000 )\nNetflix: $2,435,981 ( $11,692,713,000 / 4,800 )\n\nProfit Per Employee\nTwitter: -$31,783 ( -$108,063,000 / 3,400 )\nAmazon: $5,358 ( $3,033,000,000 / 566,000 )\nNetflix: $116,443 ( $558,929,000 / 4,800 )\nGoogle: $158,057 ( $12,662,000,000 / 80,110 )\nMicrosoft: $171,000 ( $21,204,000,000 / 124,000 )\nApple: $483,510 ( $48,351,000,000 / 100,000 )\nFacebook: $573,859 ( $15,920,000,000 / 27,742 )\n\nTwitter is still loosing money, but it is loosing a lot less than it was before.\nI didn&#8217;t realize that Netflix was so low on the number of employees, yet their revenue is in the general ball park of much larger companies.  To the studios it must look like Netflix is over there printing money.  No wonder so many other companies want to start their own streaming content service.",
