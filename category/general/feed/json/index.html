It uses plain files for storage instead of a database and was pretty easy to setup.  Unfortunately wiki software packages are much like email clients, they all of issues and problems, you just have decided which problems you are willing to deal with.  I&#8217;m not committed to DokuWiki, so if I find something else that better fits my needs I&#8217;ll be happy to change.</p>\n<p>I was rather disappointed at the state of wiki software in general.  There were several features that few (and in many cases none that I could find) that had some of the more interesting and useful features, especially for business environments.  Here&#8217;s a short (probably incomplete) wish list:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>ACLs: More packages are supporting this now, I&#8217;m still surprised that more don&#8217;t have it though.  This implies authentication, which needs to support several different methods (Database, LDAP, PAM?).</li>\n<li>Hierarchy: Name spaces are great, but I&#8217;d really like to see the ability to structure wiki pages.  I suspect this one will be more difficult that some of the other features.  My wiki should able to generate a sitemap for me.</li>\n<li>Tags: You&#8217;d think with <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/\">Flickr</a> and <a href=\"http://del.icio.us/\">del.icio.us</a> taking off, people would be all over this.  And no, I don&#8217;t think that having tags means not having a hierarchy, they should complement each other, not replace each other.</li>\n<li>Page Copy/Clone: I&#8217;d like to be able to start a new page as a copy of existing page (with a new title, link, etc) that optionally carries over all of the history of the page being copied.  The new page should have some way of linking back to the page that it was copied from.  Each source page should also be able to link to all pages that started as copies of it.</li>\n<li>Page Templates: This sort of similar to the idea of Page Copy/Clone, but with a twist.  I&#8217;d like to be to create templates, that aren&#8217;t really meant to be used as pages themselves (ACLs to prevent others from changing them?), but simply as a starting point for a new page.  So when creating a new page you get the option of using one of a list of existing templates in the system.  This could get tricky fast, for instance, if you update a template does it try to update all of the pages that used that template?  Hey, I didn&#8217;t say all of this would be easy.</li>\n<li>TrackBacks: Crossing over a bit into the world of blogs, every page on a wiki should have trackback support for other sites that link to it.  This can get complicated also, what do you do when your ACL doesn&#8217;t allow for public viewing of that page?  How do you prevent TrackBack spam?</li>\n<li>Page Comments: While your first thought might be that this is another blog cross over, it isn&#8217;t.  This stems more from seeing the success of page comments in the <a href=\"http://www.php.net/manual/en/\">PHP documentation</a>.  I would like to see a more complex set of comment options though (threaded, ability to sort on different attributes like date, etc).  More avenues for comment spam, would be less of an issue if ACLs required an account to comment on a page.</li>\n<li>Export: You should be able to export the wiki in part or in whole in a some reasonable format (XML?).  Difference in syntax formatting would be a problem.</li>\n<li>Fine Grained RSS: Many wiki packages support RSS, but with varying degrees of granularity.  I&#8217;d like to be able to subscribe to wiki wide changes, page changes, wiki wide comments, page comments and the various variations you&#8217;d be likely to thing of.  Perhaps all of the changes and comments for pages with the tag of joseph, or all changes and comments in a given namespace or hierarchy, with the option of being recursive.</li>\n<li>Wiki Wide Point In Time: Show the whole wiki how it looked at a given date and time.  Along with that I&#8217;d like to be able to some sort of diff or changelog given two different date and times.  This could potentially blow up into a huge feature, show me all the pages that were added between 1 Jan 2004 and 1 Jan 2005.  Show me all of the comments that were added between 1 Mar 2005 and 1 Apr 2005.  Show me all of the trackbacks added between 1 Apr 2005 and 1 May 2005.

Adobe has shown that it is perfectly willing to take a reasonable document platform and turn into a huge ugly mess of features (maybe they were looking at MS Office for inspiration?).</p>\n<p>Over the last few years I&#8217;ve grown increasingly disappointed with Adobe and their products.  At work we use <a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/products/framemaker/main.html\">FrameMaker</a> 7.1 for our books that we print.  From FM we generate PDFs that then go to the printer.  Sounds like a relatively straight forward process right?  If only.  Just last week I spent a whole afternoon working with our editors trying to figure out why some solid black lines were turning into dotted lines when going from FM to PDF.  After going through all of the different variations possible in this process we finally discovered that FM simply doesn&#8217;t render these lines correctly when they are too close to a graphic.

So back on Thursday (17 Mar 2005) I took the spare Fibre Channel card and put it in a test box and broke the mirror on our current Xserve RAID system (connected to an Xserve G5) and plugged it in a tried it out.  The good news is that everything seems to work just fine.  FreeBSD detected the card using the <a href=\"http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=mpt&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=0&amp;manpath=FreeBSD+5.3-RELEASE+and+Ports&amp;format=html\">mpt(4)</a> driver and found the RAID array without any problems.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/xserve/\">Apple Xserve G5</a> was up and live the whole time, so it started beeping and sending out notifications when we unplugged one portion of the mirror that I used to test FreeBSD with.  So after I started running my tests I walked over to server room again to push the system indicator light/button on the front of the Xserve G5 (just to the left of the USB port on the <a href=\"http://images.apple.com/xserve/images/xs_indextop_010604_02.gif\">front panel</a>).  So I walk in the room, hold the button down for about a second and all of the sudden the lights in the room turned off and all of the UPSs started beeping madly.  After about of second of the power being off the building generator kicked on and we had emergency power running (nice to know the generator works), so all of the UPSs went silent again.</p>\n<p>I freaked!  I thought maybe I had some how killed a circuit by pushing this button on the Xserve G5.  I walked out of the server room and discovered that the whole building was out.  A minute later we discovered that the whole <a href=\"http://www.csus.edu/\">campus</a> and surrounding area lost power, so it wasn&#8217;t anything that I did.  I&#8217;m not sure if someone took out a power pole or what, but the power came back on after twenty minutes or so.  Just to make sure I went back and pressed the system indicator light/button to see if the power would stay on.  Fortunately nothing happened, so it was just coincidence that I happened to have pushed that button at the some moment that good sized power outage happened.</p>\n<p>Of course it doesn&#8217;t make any sense that pressing that button would cause a power outage, but I was sure spooked there for a minute.

This tactic is hardly limited to large multi-national corporations, individuals do it all the time.

In general I prefer the BSD license instead of the GPL license, not in all cases, but in general.  I&#8217;m also a bigger fan of FreeBSD and Mac OS X than I am of &lt;insert your distro here&gt; Linux.  None of these stances has prevented me from using GPL software or Linux distributions.  And try I to do my best not let these preferences lower me to the level of name calling and FUD.</p>\n<p>The Linux community (and the greater Open Source community for that matter) have a lot to be proud of, they&#8217;ve made some incredible advances over the years.  No matter how you look at Open Source has made a huge contribution computing.  The Internet certainly would not be what it is today without projects like Bind and Apache.  So when I read Joe&#8217;s article on why he loves the GPL, I was disappointed to see him devote so much of hit to FUD against other licenses and Microsoft.  It is always disheartening to watch someone sink to tactics they belittle others for using.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not sure an article on supporting a specific license has to use adjectives like: greedy, gaping gaws, software pirates, BSD-bigots, fascist, bozos, kneecap-busting, air-supply cutting, baby-knifing, hollow-men, impotent, noxious and insane towards others.  Instead this makes Joe&#8217;s article feel like a mean spirited attack on everyone who doesn&#8217;t agree with his views.  In describing the &#8220;magic&#8221; of the GPL he says:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n&#8220;If you don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;m talking about, then you are probably never going to &#8220;get it&#8221; as far as the GPL, or Linux, is concerned.&#8221;\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Instead of keeping to reasons why he favors the GPL, his states that you&#8217;ll never get it.  After making personal attacks against Gates and Ballmer, he complains about the approach of attacking Richard Stallman as a substitute for attacking the GPL.  I guess it is okay for Joe to make personal attacks, but not others.  That certainly brings his credibility down a notch.  I&#8217;m sure that Joe meant well by his article, but I think he would have been more convincing if it didn&#8217;t sound so angry.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not a big Microsoft fan, but articles like this are not only not helpful, I believe they damage to the Open Source community.
